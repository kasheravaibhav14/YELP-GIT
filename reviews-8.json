The food...sensational! We enjoyed the Stout Braised Short Ribs and the HG Seafood Stew! Drinks...the Strawberry Ginger Bellini is a sure fav! We couldn't pass up dessert, we enjoyed the Macaroon Ice Cream Sandwich and the Black Bottom Banana Pie - holy smokes, delicious!!! We're so excited to have a new fabulous place to stop into in our neighborhood!",

However, for the quality and quantity of their food, dinner prices are reasonable, too. Fabulous service with Michael. He tended to every detail in a timely fashion. Great atmosphere, too.

Upon arriving, we were told they were out of the prime rib. We all really wanted it, and were bummed to hear they \"ran out\".  You think a restaurant would manage their product better, and order accordingly, especially considering this is not the first week of restaurant week, nor is it the first time it had happened according to many other reviews. We all ordered the Salmon, it was good but nothing super special, the apps and dessert as well. The server was wonderful I think his name was Michael, but not sure. He was very gracious and apologetic about the prime rib situation. He said the first round of drinks would be on him, and they were. He comped our first round of drinks!\n\nThe place has alot of potential to be something great but they clearly need more competent management, who can adequately run a restaurant and order supplies based on demand. I don't think it is acceptable to run out of the same item on multiple occasions during restaurant week of all days, with such a limited menu.",

Three of us had the prime rib and my husband had the burger the prime rib was out of this world the portion sizes were huge. They were even able to accommodate more paleo request by not putting butter on the vegetables and putting oil instead. I also got a side order of asparagus which was out of this world it was cooked perfectly. I absolutely recommend this place for dinner based on the food and the service and yes it would come back.",

I don't like seafood but my friend ordered the clan chowder since it stated that it won some award and I took a bite and then ordered my own side! It was that good! I had the soba noodle salad and they substituted chicken for ahi which was really good. We each had a girly drink, some type of Bellini cocktail and it was dangerously good! The friend ordered the nightly special with was $13.99 lobster tail! Looked good and you can't beat the price! Great location in mission hills!",

We shared the fins and shells platter as an appetizer and the Seabass and pork chops as entrees. Everything was amazing but the pork chops were TO DIE FOR! We will definitely be going back for dinner and drinks. Our server Becky took great care of us and made sure we had a fabulous dinner. Harley Gray is my favorite new spot in the neighborhood and I can't wait for it to open for brunch.",

Very uniform and lacking flavor. For less money ive had a lot better. Carls jr. Comes to mind and I haven't had fast food in 5 years. If you can prepare something as simple as a burger to customer specifications why would I try anything else? Very disappointing.  Save your money go anywhere else.  One star is warranted.

We went to dinner on a Friday night around 7:30pm.  The place was almost full but we were able to get in right away for a two-top table.  After ordering drinks, we settled into the menu.  I selected the Prime Rib special.  I believe it was around 14 or 15 dollars.  The meat was a good portion, the sides were hot and delicious.  The sides consisted of a potato and vegetables.  Service throughout the evening was appropriate and timely.  I am going to try brunch here next, but agree based on this one outing that the restaurant experience was enjoyable that makes me want to come back and try the brunch in the daytime.  I will definitely think of Harley Gray in the future when selecting a night out for dinner.",

Great location right on Washington with a nice seating layout and just enough tvs to watch sports if needed but not trying to be a sports bar.  Was disappointed the first time when I asked about the happy hour specials and noticed at the bottom \"$2 extra for doubles\" so being the cheap guy I am I ordered a double well drink.  Come to find out the $2 extra was only for he 4 happy hour fruity drinks they already had on special.  I would have expected the waiter to tell me that my doubles didn't count before he got my drink but whatever, lesson learned and I still went back.  This time we sat outside.  The margaritas were good and the pork sliders and Nachos were on par!  We will be back at some point to try out more of the menu but probably won't make it a priority unless our friends pick it.  Still 4 stars though, I recommend you try it!!",

We ordered the Garlic and Brie which was really good BUT it only came with 4 crisps so kind of wasteful when 2 people are sharing considering how much cheese and jam was included. For my main entree I tried the Chipotle Chicken Sandwich & was really impressed. Great flavor with a nice mixture of sweet and salty. Fries were also fantastic. If service steps up and the portions are right-sized this place could really be on a winning path. Look forward to checking back on them in a few months",

There are so many choices now if one includes the next few blocks on Washington.  We like to bring our Yorkies so Harley Gray is our top choice since they have remodeled and have a nice patio now.  A restaurant has to have an outstanding reason for returning, since there are so many choices and so little time to try them all.  For us it is the calamari app., the great drink prices - $3 margaritas and $5 wine, and a hunk of a waiter named Michael who is very personable.  We have tried many dinner items but keep going back to their burger.  I do wish they would add a few more spectacular food items to help them compete with The Patio down the street.  However, HH is served anywhere in the restaurant, not just at the bar (like the Famers Bottega on Washington,  who makes you sit at one of 6 bar stools)   Support our local restaurant- you will not be disappointed- prices are very reasonable and they have specials every night.",

Beware of flying lobster bits though as my partner had to get rid of a shirt afterwards - whoops!\n\nHaving had two kids it is time for an update.  We used to come here at least twice a week even with the kids.  All was ok for awhile.  They did sort of treat us like we weren't really wanted but nothing too obvious.  However, one night we came here and our kids were unsettled and not in their best mood.  We were asked to leave.  This is NOT ok for a restaurant that prides themselves on being kid friendly.

The menu items here sound better than they are in reality and, although generally well prepared, lack any real 'wow' factor.  It is average food, sad to say.  Although I've had at least 10 items on the menu, nothing has been excellent and I find myself returning out of convenience rather than a desire to visit. I will not mention specific items as I have been to the restaurant several times, except to say I am a fan of the club sandwich on the dinner menu.  I hope this restaurant is not content to be the lowest priced alternative on the street. I would encourage them to pursue excellence and signature items with stronger zeal. With increasing competition, every other restaurant in the area exceeds their quality and dining experience.  One positive note is the indoor/outdoor nature of the space, even if another restaurant two doors down does the same thing with much more panache.  Generally, I do not think of the wait staff here as memorable, but I don't think that is a concept this restaurant values in it's food or dining experience.  Please, Harley Gray, it's time to up your game!!!",

We love Brooklyn Girl, The Red Door, Wellington, Cafe Bleu - all great spots with interesting, fresh food, great atmosphere & changing menus. So we were intrigued by Harley Gray's menu which looked like, well, bar food. Not comfort food. Bar food. But thought we'd give it a try and support a small business. The service was fine, a high point in comparison to the food.  As suspected, this is low-quality bar food that I would expect to find in a touristy restaurant in Seaport Village. The salad wasn't fresh, overdressed. Ceviche? Watery and unappetizing.  Short ribs were fine but wouldn't return as there is little else on the menu that looks promising.  There are just so many great spots in the 'hood (and soon to be another, with The Patio opening) to waste money here.  Really hoped for more and maybe with a chef change and dramatic menu shift they can turn it around. The other restaurants are packed in the 3-block radius so there are customers to be had.",

I had one of the more expensive items on the menu, Lobster  Benedict with fruit instead of potatoes and he had the French Toast.  The poached eggs were WAY over done on the Benedict and the portion of lobster was \"modest\".  Not sure why they included so much red pepper as it distracted from meal.  When I told the server the eggs were over done, he said \"sorry about that\" and offered nothing else.  I probably could have pushed the point and asked for it to be redone but I was rather hungry.  My husband's \"French Toast\" was actually just heated cinnamon bread with butter, whipped cream syrup and some fruit.  Oh, and they charged to substitute the potatoes for fruit which we didn't know about until the check came...not a big deal but would have been nice to know that.  Too bad our visit was disappointing.  It's a cute place and great for people watching but we won't be back.",

Like the ambiance, the service is amazing, drink bowls are tasty and fun but the food is barely mediocre.  If HG's owners don't do something about their food I doubt this place will make it for very long especially now that The Patio opened next door.  The food when this was the Gathering may have been better.  We live in the neighborhood and want to see local businesses do well so hope HG either gets a new cook, changes it's food offerings or all of the above.

I must say that the lobster dinner was just delightful with a nice steamed veggie side and some pretty forgettable rice.  Our biggest issues were at the beginning and the end however. I had the happy hour watermelon lemonade and was invited to make it a double, I think they forgot the alcohol. I'm a light drinker and did not feel the slightest buzz on finishing the coctail. The other problem was dessert. We decided to share the Mile High Chocolate cake.  The table next to us got the huge portion of Mud Pie and as all the desserts were 7.95 we expected something similar in size.  Oh my, a tiny 1\" stale  slice was presented flat on the plate. I was disappointed but did not want to make a fuss in front of our dinner companions,  but that was just pitiful!  Especially when the server knew we were going to share. There needs to be a bit more consistency in things folks.  We will probably be back for the lobster special, but will go with the wine as happy hour drink and mud pie for dessert. I can't say we would recommend to friends without a cautionary tale.",

I don't recall our servers name, but he was on point and very friendly. The owner even stopped by our table to make sure we were having a good experience. Lovely place which I will for sure be back at. Bonus: they have maui coconut poter!",

There's no reason ( well - cost could be one) to have non-local brew taps.  I think you could cover any style you were going for locally... and having the IPA from out of town is offensive(IMO).",

The atmosphere was fine but it would be nice to see some diners since I only see 4 people at the bar.  I started with asking for a glass of cab that was on their happy hour menu...but the waiter said it was not offered this night.  The brie appetizer was a nice presentation but I could not taste the brie with the overpowering crust around it.  There was only one sandwich option for vegetarians and no entree option even after I asked so I got a beet salad that came with wilted lettuce. I then had asparagus as a side that looked gorgeous but was not seasoned.   The Mudd pie came deeply frozen and served with a knife to cut through the deep freeze. It was really good once it was allowed to thaw a little.  The server was very nice but inexperienced.  I was really hoping for a good experience so I could have another local place to go to but I don't think I will give it another shot for a while since the food wasn't anything to come back for.

The tacos they are promoting need a vegetarian option (I know that's not the focus of this place but it should at least try to get some money from that demographic).

                  "review": "At 9:30 AM Saturday. I was the only customer, (two other tables were occupied before I left) . It took a bit, as I stood there (there is no hostess stand)  for a waitress to appear. She said I could sit wherever I liked. The bartender must have seen me standing there, but said nothing. The first table I sat at was unstable, and I moved to another.\nThe pleasant waitress at my request reduced the volume of the awful, boom-boom drums \"music\"    (but not low enough).\nFrom the  Sat & Sun Brunch menu, I ordered eggs benedict ($13).  They were the worst I've ever had:\n-One egg was so far beyond poached it had a fully-cooked yolk\n-The other egg was 3/4 firm yolk, the rest liquid as a poached egg should be.\n-The English muffin was soggy, it had not been toasted enough, if at all.\n-A small round slice of ham (perhaps it was  Canadian bacon) was tough and flavorless.\n-There was a thin application of hollandaise, which had no discernible flavor.\n-The eggs benedict was cold.\n-There was a small, thin triangle of watermelon, also flavorless.\n-The only good thing on the plate was home fries, but they were not even warm.\n\nThe waitress asked how I liked the meal, I told her the above. she offered to \"take it back to the kitchen,\" but I didn't have time. I got through one egg/muffin (I was hungry), but could not hack the second or the cold fries. Without my asking, they took $8.25 off the bill. Eggs benedict are $13. (I forget what the coffee I had cost.) You decide if that was adequate.\n\nIf I was the only one who'd reviewed the food as poor, I might think mine was an aberration, and try Harley Gray again, but enough Yelpers agree with me that I don't think I'll return.\n\nHow HG can be this bad, in many respects, is puzzling, as the company seems to own other restaurants. It's been open since June, enough time to correct errors of a new business.\n\nI never had a bad dish when it was The Gathering. The amount of food was more generous, also.",

Being one that has to find out \"why\" we went in for a late lunch. Long story short, we've been there three times in a little over a week. Food is very good, not great, but very good, attractive decor, every thing is spic and span, attentive staff, weekend brunch menu had enough options where you can't figure out what to order. Go, you won't be disappointed.",

My friends and I visited on a Friday evening after 6pm and we were only the second occupied table. The service was prompt and friendly but that is the best I can say about it.\nWe ordered a green lip mussel appetizer. We love green lips and have had them prepared numerous ways and this takes the award for the worst ever. Not only were they over cooked but they hadn't been prepped properly. i.e the beards had not been removed and the broth seemed sandy as if they had not even been washed.\nOn to the entrees. My friend and his wife each ordered the grilled sea bass. I made a comment to the waitress that most cooks tend to over cook grilled sea bass in an effort to get nice grill markings. The waitress mentioned that the parent company was the Boathouse restaurant and their cooks were experts with fish. Never the less I asked her to make a note not to over cook the fish. Guess what? Yep. It was dry, over cooked and tasteless. My friend and I each ordered the honey glazed pork chop and I asked for mine to be cooked medium rare. Pink in the middle is okay by me. When the server brought the food they asked who had the medium but when we cut into them they were both well done. I guess their cooks don't know that meat continues to cook after you take it off the grill.\nOn to the sides. It has long been my belief that you should not put anything on the plate that is not edible. Obviously, not their tradition. The asparagus had not been prepped and was served with 3-4 inches of white inedible stalks. Over all a pretty disappointing visit. I doubt we will return as there are many other choices in the neighborhood.",

We had been so excited to try Harley Gray as we had passed by this restaurant many times and it looked so cute.  We arrived right at 6:30 and were asked if we wanted to sit inside or out.  The place was fairly busy but there were quite a few open tables inside and out.  We chose to sit inside and were seated next to a few tables with diners at them.  And then we sat.  About 5 minutes into our wait, the hostess came over and gave us water and let us know our server would be right with us.  We waited another 5 minutes, all the while 2 servers kept walking back and forth right by our table.  A group of 4 people walked in and were seated 2 tables over from us and were immediately greeted by their server and their drink orders were taken.  We waited another 5 minutes and decided to leave right as the group of 4 were receiving their drinks.  Not once did a server acknowledge us.  Needless to say, we were very disappointed, and very worried since it was 6:45 on Valentine's night.  We ended up across the street at The Red Door which had much better service.",

My friend got the iced salted caramel latte and enjoyed that.\n\nTons of outdoor seating and on a quiet street. We even walked around a local park and plant nursery after.

Once she left another team member stated, \"why does she always talk to you like that, it's not ok\".\n\nAnd that truly hurt my heart because I have seen similar toxic work cultures where the boss feels like they can speak to their employees however they'd like. While I understand the stress of owning a business, I refuse to ever let that be an excuse to allow toxic behavior.\n\nI still love this cafe and how special it is, and I hope the owner can take some time to take a step back and think about the impact her words/energy can make, gain some self-awareness, and uplift her team.",

The decorations gave me a zen like or meditation vibes whicb made me feel relaxed. They also sell cute jewelry, oils/sprays, sage and other items for the home. This immediately captured my attention upon entering then I remembered that I was there to order a drink.\n\nI like to try and find the drink that makes a cafe different than the others. With this place stoodout with their Tumeric Latte. The barista was super nice and recommended I order it warm instead of cold (turmeric wouldn't taste that great cold). Glad I did order the Turmeric Latte warm because the honey and other items in the drink (not sure but I think I saw pepper) came together nicely. You would think that the tumeric would have a strong taste, but not in this drink. The barista did a great job in putting in the right amount of tumeric and honey. This is the perfect drink on a cold morning and moreso if you happen to be sick.\nSee all photos from Vina R. for Kettle & Stone",

                  "review": "We actually first went to Kettle and Stone on a scavenger hunt put together by my mom whose hunt directed us to come here to order a black cherry basil lemonade.\n\nI had a chai latte that first visit and was impressed, especially since I'm really picky about my chai and this place was totally off my radar despite lots of chai searches on Yelp. They have two kinds of chai and I got the sweet housemade blend, as opposed to the tea bag. It was pretty good and not too sweet.\n\nI loved the hygge vibe of this place with an interior that included rustic benches topped with pillows. It made me want to linger. I wish this was the interior of Cafe Bassam which has superior chai but an inferior interior (say that three times fast) cluttered with tables, containers of tea leaves, and stuff on the walls that probably hasn't been dusted in fifteen years.\n\nWe liked Kettle and Stone enough that we returned a week later after hiking the Robyn's Egg Trail. This time we got kinds of lemonade (all - gulp - $4.75 each) as well as my chai. The son had the black cherry basil lemonade again which (like it did a week before) sounds better than it tastes. It's watery and not particularly lemonade-like. It reminded me of Vitamin Water. The husband really likes it though, so to each his own. The best part is the real cherries at the bottom. We also had the ginger lemonade (sharp tasting and no one liked but the husband) and the regular lemonade (not listed and not fancy but tastes the best).\n\nThis time we also shared the blueberry banana bread. It was really good and very banana-y.\n\nCan we talk about the name, \"Kettle and Stone\"? I can never remember the second word. I always want to call it \"Kettle and Pot.\"\n\nSan Diego Chai Rankings\n\nRecommended:\nCafe Bassam, Bankers Hill\n2) KETTLE & STONE, MISSION HILLS\n3) Chi Chocolate/Banyan Kitchen & Cafe, Point Loma (chocolate chai)\n4) Sidecar Donuts, Del Mar (best as iced chai)\n5) Darshan Bakery, Encinitas\n6) Naked Cafe, Point Loma (golden fairy dust)\n-----\nWould Not Order Again:\n7) Cardamom Cafe, North Park (closed)\n8) Brew, La Mesa\n9) Coffee S3, Grantville",

There are also outlets lining the edge of all the walls so I can always find a spot to plug in my computer.\n\nTheir pastries are the best, I personally like the pumpkin muffin. They don't have full on meals that you can buy but they have substantial snacks like muffins, yogurt, oatmeal's, quiche's, cookies, doughnuts and of course coffee, tea, and speciality drinks.\n\nI highly suggest kettle and Stone if you are looking for a relaxing environment on a quiet street with good quality coffee !!  \n\nOh I forgot to mention there is outdoor seating for your beautiful San Diego summer morning\nThis is me working near the back of the coffee shop with the sound of a water fountain!!",

I've spent the past two years coming to this coffee shop and I'm surprised it took me this long to review!!\n\nThis place is like a second home to me, in fact I'm currently writing this review sitting in my favorite spot in the shop lol. I've spent so much time studying here and just hanging out and grabbing coffee with friends because the ambience is amazing! They have a fountain on constantly which gives the best calming environment to work or study and they always have the best music playing. The staff is fantastic they are always so kind and accommodating and if you're a frequent customer they'll make it a point to get to know you (which I think is so awesome). Not to mention if you have kids this place is also great for families to hang out and catch up with friends and what not and they have a lot of items that are perfect for your kiddos such as their \"not so hot chocolate\".\n\nNow to what you've probably been waiting for: THE COFFEE\nIn my opinion, Kettle & Stone has some of the best coffee (+tea) in San Diego and that's saying a lot because I'm a coffee addict and have tried more coffee shops in the area than I can count. I've tried everything from their cappuccino to the peppermint mocha in the winter to their chai latte and I haven't had one thing that I didn't like.\n\nIf you're in the neighborhood please do yourself a favor and check this place out :)",

I get whatever their house coffee, basic, in a for-here mug, and plop on a wood bench. Easy place to be anonymous and breaking down to the basic of a cup of coffee.\nOpen seating, indoors or out...comfy benches and pillows. Perfect fall day!",

It's a relatively small place but they do have a decent amount of tables inside and outside. The seats are very comfy and they have a small display for random knick-knacks. I didn't see any outlets but then again I wasn't actively looking for any. This would be a great place for reading as the general noise level isn't that disturbing.",

I am shocked that living in the same neighborhood how could we never found out about them..I thank yelp for this find and my fellow yelp members who wrote highly about this.\n\nLocation:- Perfecto. Located in an amazing neighborhood and safe as well.\n\nAmbience:- We loved its outdoor seating which reminded me of places in London and Europe. They have a great indoor seating as well. People come there all the time for meetings and work related stuff. In the center there is beautiful piece of art and in the very corner they have a cute little boutique jewelry shop, which was cool. The best part was that their menu was written in big block letters which was easily visible.\n\nStaff:- Courteous and nice.\n\nI have given 4 stars instead of 5 coz of one thing that is their coffee prices are on s higher side or else this place is really cool.\n\nLovely place, will visit soon!!!",

I love how there so much wood. The benches are perfect and comfortable, the pillows are very soft. The table has a very pretty color to it. There's big windows in the front, so you get that perfect amount of sunlight. There is some ceramic plates and such that you can buy from the middle table along with some spiritual items. Burning sage bundles, crystals, etc. On the right hand side there are some jewelry as well. One of the shelfs is made with eucalyptus tree wood, it's spectacular and very well made.\n\nThe pastries come from Bread & Cie! So delicious.\n\nOnward to the coffee. I had an iced salted caramel latte (for sit down). Regular, not decaf. I say, it's strong. But not too strong that it is overpowering the salted caramel. I think it's a thin caramel, but it's very good. I'm not too sure that it's salted, because I've just had so many salted caramels I can barely tell the difference anymore. I'd definitely order it again though.\n\nThe lady working there was very easy to keep a conversation with and she was very sweet.\nIced salted caramel latte\nDecorations from above.",

The tea was aromatic and smooth, and no doubt tasted great. The French croissant was terrific and a great buttery texture with a moist and soft interior and flaky crust. The tea and croissant were a great pair.\n\nThe young lady who prepared my tea was hip and down to earth friendly.

Also Love La Belage Boutique and all the other special shops.\nYou will feel embraced from the minute you step out of your car.\nSee all photos from Cristina C. for Kettle & Stone",

There are a few shops surrounded by residential houses in Mission Hills. Walking up to the cafe I felt like I was in some mountain town! The inside was so quaint and relaxing. Artwork hung up for sale, a little area selling jewelry and household stuff.\n\nThis place mainly has coffee and small pastries. I got a honey violet latter with almond milk and it wasn't too bad but wasn't the best I've had. The pastries were decent but not sure if they were made from scratch.\n\nThe only thing that dropped it down a star was flies everywhere. Maybe they need to crank the a/c because I had to keep an eye on my pastries to make sure they didn't land on it. Other than that love the seating inside and outside and the fact it's not a place where there would be a long wait.\nSee all photos from Jenny K. for Kettle & Stone",

Enter Kettle & Stone.\n\nTo be honest, when I sent Trish the link to our meeting place I thought it was for another spot in Mission Hills so we'll have to call the discovery of K&S a very happy accident! The shop is quaint, the neighborhood is calm, parking is easy and they'll serve you up a hot cup of loose leaf tea - that's what I had. We posted up on one of the outside tables with our computers, talked shop and watched customers come and go. It was never overly busy and dogs would occasionally walk by with their owners stopping at the front door to lap water from the courtesy dog bowl.\n\nThe coolest part of the entire set up is that they share the space with a really rad boutique selling cool little odds and ends, jewelry and artwork. I can't remember the name of this particular section of the shop but I'll certainly be stopping by for some Christmas shopping... tea in hand!",

They pumped us full of delicious coffee and we sat outside along the sidewalk. Multiple puppies passed us, it was a good day!\n\nIndoors you'll find lovely things in the shop portion of the store, from Jonathan Adler items to local gems, I could have bought one of everything and particularly liked the pendant jewelry they had at the counter - circular gold pieces with astrological signs imprinted on them. Little matchbooks, clever bar tools, it's all there so if you have a need for a gift and want to grab a coffee and pastry as well, here is your one stop neighborhood shop.\n\nStreet parking, wasn't bad on a weekday afternoon.",

There are a couple sitting area outside that works as a good place to sit and enjoy the coffee and the surrounding. As you enter, the store is split into  two section. The first section is the coffee side, and the second is a cute craft store. The vintage and brick atmosphere makes up the interior of the store. I went around 9 and it was pretty busy. The menu was a great size. Not too much or not too little. I asked the cashier what she recommended and she said that the popular drink is the salted carmel latte but it didn't appeal to me. So I went for the vanilla cold brew.\n\nVanilla cold brew: (5/10) this taste like your standard cold brew. Nothing really special about it captured me. It was surely smooth but I didn't taste the vanilla. I was honestly expecting better because the worker said it was one of the best she has tasted.\n\nThe workers were really friendly and made my visit worthwhile! But I would give this place a second chance!\nThe interior is absolutely stunning.\nVanilla cold brew! Very smooth but do not taste the vanilla syrup.",

There are two quiches, two sandwiches and several pastries and not much else.  There are two gluten free pastry choices, almond or pistachio, and both of fairly heavy, kinda oily, and not much flavor.  Sooooo, I do like the coffee, the almond milk lattes are great, hot or cold.  The girls who work here are very nice too.",

Seriously, one of the best iced lattes I've ever had. They have air conditioning inside, which I was super happy about today because it was weirdly very hot outside this morning. They offer an assortment of pastries and they also have this amazing sundried tomato feta quiche. The service is good and you can tell the baristas are really trying their best. They sell local handmade goods on the right side of the shop and I'm always a fan of local businesses scratching eachother's backs like this. The atmosphere is calm and great for working or meeting up with a friend. Anytime I've come here, I've never had a problem finding street parking.\n\nCONS: I'm not giving it 5 stars because sometimes they only have one employee taking people's orders and also having to making people's coffee. Therefore, the line can become long and it may take a while to get your drink. Also, there's really not very much indoor seating, so on really hot summer days (today was upper 80s and it will get hotter later in the summer) sitting outside isn't very pleasant.",

I ordered a flat white, the espresso came out a bit rough and had a burnt taste, but the milk muffled that profile, so I didn't mind.\n\nThey work better on their flavored drinks instead of the pure coffee experience. Great place for a morning coffee and pastry (the pastries look amazing by the way). I definitely have to come back here and order a few more things before I change my review or leave it.\n\nThis is definitely a check it out place though, the ambiance is mellow and pretty catered to the young professional crowd.",

After getting my hair cut and a long work week, I was exhausted so I looked for the nearest coffee shop.  Here I am at Kettle and Stone.  The coffee shop shares a space with a small boutique and it is adorable.  It seems like such a great community to share space.  Everyone in the coffee shop was friendly and warm.  I chatted with the lady behind me that had just gone for a walk with her friends and she has lived in the neighborhood for years.  There was also a flyer for Halloween in the Hills on the 1600 block of West Lewis street.  They will have food trucks, live music, tarot readers, fortune tellers and family friendly fun.\nSure my coffee was good, but it was more of the warm welcoming atmosphere and the friendly people that come here.\nMegan the Barista",

However, during my most recent visit, I was up-charged $1.50 after asking for no ice in my cup (???). This has been a FREE option at every other coffee shop I've been to where I've ordered cold brew. What made it especially off putting was the fact that this now $5.75 drink (16 oz) was more expensive than the largest cup that they offer (20 oz at $4.75). Having mixed feelings about returning now :/",

If I need some relaxing this is pretty much my first go to. The coffee is a bit pricey for my college girl budget but it doesn't usually keep me away. (I think it might be due to the fancy yummy flavor they put in- I'm just used to getting cappuccinos). The only other reason I'm not rating it a 5 star is due to lack of comfy comfy seats but they are still super cute and perfect.\nOutdoor seating is the way to go. For sure. Favorite part of SD.",

Anyway, I appreciate that they do use local roasters.\n\nThis place is essentially located in a boutique. My friend and I had a good time looking around, sipping our super watered down americanos (disappointing. it was just like hot water), and chatting with the very friendly workers here.\n\nI would definitely come back here because it's in what is possibly the cutest street in all of San Diego, the people here are so nice, and the atmosphere is perfect for chatting in the morning with some friends over coffee.\n\nHowever, if I were to give some tips: There is a lot of potential here for really good coffee, but maybe the baristas need more training or something? I might have just had an off-cup but it was underextracted and SUPER watered down. Next time I'll order something else/be more specific about the amount of water I'd like in my americano and will update accordingly. Not bad, but not good.",

I would be a regular at all the places if I lived in the neighbourhood, but I do get there at least every every six weeks or so when I go next door to Studio 25 for a haircut or bang trim. I happened in on their first day open before they really had the boutique set-up and they have really done a great job filling out the space.\n\nToday's treat was their Guatemalan regular brew and a blueberry cornmeal muffin. For the life of me, I cannot remember the bakery they use, but everything I've tried and all the things I've salivated over has tasted/looked divine. I am a just coffee in my coffee kind of gal and theirs is top notch as far as regular brewed coffee goes,\n\nThe only downside I've come across thus far is that the brew pots are next to the register so if there's a line, you have to squeeze through to get to the coffee. Luckily, I bring my own cup and fill up while waiting for my turn at the register. The clientele are always relaxed and good-natured though. There is usually just one barista and it can be a slow line at times, but I say, just hold your horses and enjoy your day. If you want assembly line, there's a place on University that can help you out.\n\nThe baristas and shop staff are always welcoming when I walk in and the banter is delightful. They have a few tables inside as well as out for you to take a respite before heading off to other locales. Sitting under the trees taking in the lovely surroundings is the way to go.

The baristas are very skilled in the craft they do I've tried many different latte's... salted Carmel, chai tea, mocha Mexicana. I can't complain about any them they are all my favorites! Whatever your in the mood for they have it all. Cold brew, pour over, iced lattes, kombucha's. I would highly recommend anyone stop in an try it for themselves!\nHoney chai tea latte with a shot of espresso in a personal cup! The cake is a gluten free almond cake that melts in your mouth!",

I had a fantastic, foamy cappuccino that was made from some great beans. After my group was done, I had fun browsing the boutique store inside the coffee shop/shoppe. My one regret is not trying one of the pastries or sandwiches available on the counter.",

The music is calm and the store is well lit. The barista recommended to me the dark chocolate mocha which I enjoyed but $4.50 for a small cup seemed steep. The crowd it seems to attract are the older wealthier bunch, which make sense given its location. I would stop by again if I'm in the area, but the drink wasn't good enough for me to go out of my way for it. It is what it is, place is that sweet grandma type of cute and everything is overpriced but you'll walk through and stare at all the cool things you'll never buy.",

It was so cozy and homey inside, and the barista was so warm and friendly. She suggested a cinnamon roll and banana bread muffin to share with our water and espressos. You all should try them both. They taste like lovely homemade goodness and aren't overly sweet. Just right. Needless to say, we'll definitely be back.",

Mission Hills has needed a shop like this for a while.  I haven't tried their pastries, but they look amazing.  Ultimately the ambience is top tier and as a new business owner in the Mission Hills community I'll be frequenting this place often and referring lots of people here.  Well done Kettle & Stone!",

We had a great time looking up everyone at our table and ended up staying long enough to top off our breakfast with some kombucha. This is a great neighborhood spot - not just for the actual neighbors, but for anybody who needs a little dose of community with their coffee.",

The tables and heat lamps were out on the sidewalk and the door was open which welcomed me in.  There was a good energy inside which I would attribute to not only the people working, but also the various crystals and sage that are around the shop. After my Vanilla Bean Latte and Apricot Scone order was completed by the friendly barista in a distressed Beatles TShirt (star points for the shirt!) I enjoyed them both outside at one of the tables.   The latte was perfectly balanced and at an appropriate temperature and the apricot scone tasted as is an Irish Mum has made it that morning. There is a little shop on the side that sells really cute items - good for gifts for sure!  I have lived in this neighborhood for 8 years and this street is truly one of the gems of the neighborhood.  What a great place to grab a latte and a bite. Cool, calm vibe!  I give it 5 stars!",

The space is cute but pretty tight inside. It's 1/2 boutique and 1/2 coffee shop. It feels more like a coffee counter in a boutique & less like a true coffee shop. There are a few tables inside  off to the side. Service was eh. Not very friendly or welcoming-kind of aloof (surprisingly from both sides, the coffee + boutique). Drink menu was a bit hard to read as a portion of it was blocked by a gigantic plant. They have self serve coffee-three types (light, medium and dark Mexican coffees). Coffee was just okay. I wanted a pour over which was on the drink menu but was told they are not equipped for it yet. Ooookay...how about erasing it from the blackboard then? Was definitely disappointed by the entire experience. I love coffee and checking out new local joints (happy I checked it out), but probably won't be back. I'll stick to my go-tos: Caffe Calabria, James Coffee and Intelligentsia coffee (which so far I've only found at La Marque and Streetcar).",

We arrive at 8:45pm. Signed in maybe 15 mins after 9(kareoke start time).\n\nWe sat there for 3 hours. 3 HOURS and nothing. We were only on the second page.\n\nI go check out whats going on, twice to see why havent they called any of our names. The first time, i review the sign up sheet and see only around 8 people were ahead. The second time i check The DJ starts to explain to me, that there is no particular order.\n\nPeople tip him, and he favors tables that have been reserved. As I was speaking to him people were signing up, tipping him therefore being called earlier than the people waiting for hours.\n\nSo, apparently if you dont sneak the dj money or get a vip table, you wont be singing within the first 4 hours.\n\nNot fair,\nNot a kareoke bar, more like a club/occasional kareoke if you get lucky.\nWe just wanted to sing, and we bought plenty of booze. Really disappointed.\nNot a kareoke bar. Maybe on a weekday its emptier abd youll get a chance\u200d\n\nOr at least maybe warn your guests it doesn't matter when u sign up, it doesn't matter. Cash and Dj personal preference matter. Its a scam, also bartender wasn't friendly, bathrooms were so gross and smelly, you couldn't walk without grinding up on someone else.\nSave your cash and time.",

As my cousin would say the smell gives it a soul.  Cash only people.  There is an ATM on sight in case you need it.  Also there's a neat little patio area if you want air and your drink outside.  I saw a pool table, some cush little booths to sit in, and what appears to be a little dance floor area.  Definitely a must spot amongst the drinking options in MH.\nKaraoke?",

I believe my friend was the target of a \"professional team\"; a seemingly friendly, attractive and charming young couple sitting at a booth and just waiting and watching for the right mark to get their \"payday.\" They found what they were looking for and that just happened to be my innocent and unsuspecting friend.

Definition of a dive bar is that they could care less about how loud your laugh may be. I have never in my life been more embarrassed.\n\nI am with colleagues and have 2 tequila shots and 1 beer, clearly not inebriated. Talking to colleagues about their journey to marriage and I was singled out since my \"voice carries and I shouldn't yell\". I was not yelling, there was music blaring in the background but 2 older gentlemen complained I was annoying them so they told the bartender who clearly didn't' have experience deescalating situations. It's a Thursday night and I'm sorry, I will laugh however I please. Had he approached me in a professional manner instead of mocking my laugh I would not be writing this review. However the bartender tonight made fun of my voice and disregarded me completely. Again, this has NEVER HAPPENED TO ME.\nPlus we spent over $150 in less than 45 minutes and would have spent more had this not happened.\n\nGo somewhere else where you won't be judged.  If you want a true dive bar experience, this is NOT THE PLACE. On 26 August ay 8:30PM, the bartender was a complete arrogant asshole and I will never recommend this place for drinks. There are so many other places to enjoy the company of their friends.\n\nFor the record, we weren't drunk, we were NOT the loudest group, and he clearly didn't care about having a conversation with me since he walked away mid conversation after I tried to have a conversation with the bartender because I'm an adult and can use my words unlike him. At this rate I am very surprised you are able to be open, then again if you keep catering to old white men I see why your bartender cares so much.  Pathetic and will never EVER come here again.\n\nPlus the booze seems watered down from the 2 shots I had (which were supposedly Don Julio), you can do much better somewhere else.\n\nPeople I was with had been going for years as native San Diegans and will never be returning due to the piss service and disrespect tonight.\n\nThanks for nothing!",

I also like if you choose to sing you're not fully blasted on the speaker so you feel awkward, my friends and I can't sing but we'd definitely have fun singing ans dancing together on the \"stage\" next time together.

The Dj was awesome and he actually was playing piano for some of the songs. You would never guess bc it's hidden and he was perfectly with the songs. Karaoke is always a blast and it got me out of my comfort zone singing in front of everyone at the bar. Definitely will be back and recommend to others.

If it's the last spot for those reasons then fine, but I don't think of Lamplighter almost ever!\nThe old white bartender was/is a jerk. Made me feel un welcome, seemed unhappy and was an all round jerk. Thanks, guy. Can't wait to come back in few for my next drink....\nHonestly don't go here. They only take cash which is just another hassle you don't need. Especially if you don't have any on you and now you gotta be \"that person\". Karaoke is so much more fun at PunchBowl Social. You literally know and get what you pay for! Not to mention, at Punchbowl Social, you and your friends get your own room for an hour. That is way better than going to Lamplighter and getting one song in (if you're lucky).\nThe beer selection is pretty little and the beer they do have is Bud Light and Racer 5. Brutal if you ask me, only because Mission Hills/North Park area has a lot of craft beer spots and if you're trying to sell to that demographic- you'd think you would have more than Bud and Coors Light.\nLike I said, the place is, eh. Go if you have to but there are so many other great spots for drinks and karaoke.",

Doing a $20 cover fee for a dive bar with cockroaches outside because you are willing to break both fire hazard and covid rules to let however many people yoy want in. Obviously there will be more demand for a bar that doesn't care about rules. Doesn't mean you can charge 20 bucks a person to get in for a dive bar. Their other option was $200 for bottle service which came with a dive bar table. wtf. Give me a break.\n\nUpdate: they let us in for $10. Still too much for the bar itself and I'm sure they know that but for the atmosphere and watching people sing karaoke I think its worth it. I've had a lot of other great times here but to see this place try to take advantage tonight was disappointing.",

The design of the whole bar is very interesting and unique! The layout is awesome as well if you need a break from the dance floor they have an extended patio area to sit and enjoy your drink and collect yourself from the crowd. I will say the only downfall is the small bathroom, literally on two people can fit there at a time. But overall a great bar and dance space to enjoy with any of your friends.",

                  "review": "Last weekend, my roommate and I decided to go out for karaoke. I've been to the Lamplighter before, and thought that it would be fun. They advertised online for nightly karaoke, and I thought it would be a fun evening.\n\nWe arrived around 8pm at the bar. Parking in the Mission Hills area isn't great, but we found a pretty close spot just around the corner from the bar. We went in and saw that the place had gotten a little pick me up from the last time I had gone there. They built a new outdoor patio area, and both my roommate and I thought it looked pretty nice.\n\nThe drinks were overpriced, $9 for a well shot, and there were no set prices for anything. I had to pay for several drinks and the bartender looked like he was making the prices up as he went. But whatever, I thought, I was here for the karaoke. I switched to a cherry coke because I needed the caffeine to keep me awake. I tried the maraschino cherries and they tasted expired, meaning I ordered another cherry coke with no cherries. The karaoke jockey (KJ) finally got going at 9:30. Apparently this is a regular thing, since the bartender said that he always showed up late. The security guard came in around 9pm and cleared out all the stools, so my roommate and I got one of the two small tables in the karaoke area.\n\nI got my name added to the list twice. The kj seemed nice enough, I tipped him a couple bucks and got ready to sing. I got up fairly quickly and performed. By this time, the bar began filling up with people, and many of them seemed nice enough. It got a bit more crowded than I would have liked, but I was glad I got my name on the list twice. Then a couple girls who had had a few too many drinks got up to perform. The kj made some passive apology about them jumping the line, and I was a bit puzzled, but didn't think much of it. After a while, and way more people than I thought were in front of me sang, I worked my way through the thickening crowd to the booth to check on my name. I saw that I was three away, and went back to my seat. Another several songs later, and I still had not gotten my second song in. I worked my way again through the crowd and saw that I had indeed been skipped. The kj turned to me and said roughly, \"You're probably wondering why you got skipped.\" I nodded and he continued. \"I've been letting some people jump the line cause they tipped me like eighty bucks.\" I was floored. I know people had been bringing him drinks, but for people to be tipping for him to jump the line was crazy. He told me not to pay him and that he would get me up in the next four songs.\n\nFour songs go by, and I still had not gotten to go again, so I again went back. He apologized and said if I could be patient a little longer, then I'd get to go again, at which point I said to scratch me from the list.\n\nIf you're looking for an overpriced bar/karaoke spot in Mission Hills, and are willing to pay to play, the Lamplighter is for you. This experience left a taste in my mouth worse than the expired cherries.",

Then got the ticket right away without being asked if we wanted anything else and never was looked at again. We would have easily drank for hours here but sadly the service SUCKED & was ignored after the bill was dropped off. FYI there was 2 other people at the bar and maybe 15 people by the karaoke.

( I tipped every drink I ordered an adequate amount that night). Anyways he made a big childish petty scene about it that was very unnecessary and inappropriate. The other bartenders that served me were the utmost professional. Just thought I would let you know so that he doesn't treat other customers like that.",

But the worst part about this bar is the karaoke guy is a crook!! He takes your $20, $40, or greater and then still puts up his shorty singers. The place is tiny. Too crowded. Honestly there are 30\nBars within 5 miles that are SO MUCH BETTER!! I will never go back. Total unfriendly, dirty, karaoke bar that doesn't actually let anyone new sing karaoke.",

For me, bars were a thing of the past in much younger times. A  social hangout stop with friends (conversation and a cocktail).  \n\nI was visiting a friend in San Diego. After dinner, we walked into this  bar. She (my friend) likes the dark, cool, homey-dive  atmosphere of this bar. Now, I too, am a fan of this unpretentious, Mid-Century style bar.  \n\nI am told that folks come here for the karaoke. Before the singing started, cool music with dancing set the tone.  As it got later, more people showed up. We stayed for about one hour.  Unfortunately, we could not stay up for karaoke due to a very early start to our day. Also, I am a bit on the right side of the age spectrum.\n\nPatrons ranged from late 20s to 60s. Most tended to fall on the left side of the age spectrum. No pretentious behaviors noticed. There was just good conversation and serious drinks.\n\nGood neighborhood bar for good times.",

It was our first time at Lamplighter and we had heard so much about it that we were very excited. We got their early and put our names on the list that had maybe 9 people ahead of us. Within the next two hours we noticed several people sing twice, and we didn't get called. We thought something was up so we asked the dj and he told us \"If you tip me I will let you sing\" I'm all for tipping but if I had to pay to do karaoke I would have done that instead of wait 2 hours and still not be called. The stars are for the bartenders and atmosphere itself. Honestly a total let down of a Karaoke bar. Call me old fashion but if people tip you to do karaoke then you keep going down the list of people who signed up hours before and slide your tippers in. Or just charge for karaoke.  I found the DJ extremely unprofessional. He was there to host karaoke all it felt like was him trying to hussle everyone who wanted to sing. Either way we won't be coming back to do karaoke only for the bar itself.",

He sure knows how to make you feel unwanted at a bar, don't say thank you or acknowledge a tip, won't welcome you when you walk in, and rolls his eyes to make you look stupid if you ask any questions at all.\n\nIf you like to feel unwanted for no reason, then this is the place for you :D",

There were some people that sing as if they've released records, others--not so much... but everyone is supportive to those on stage.        \n\nMinor gripes:  \n-The waitlist to sing was about an hour\n-DJ remixed some songs in-between singers but did it poorly because he didn't let the song play out long enough.  And when the song got to a good part, he'd change it to a different song completely from a different genre.",

I started on Miramar (Off Base Bar), then tried Kearny Mesa (Carriage House).\nHowever, the lamplighter has been the only place that consistently has good service, great karaoke, they're not trying to charge you Pacific Beach prices, and the karaoke host, GET THIS, is actually a decent person.\nNever once did we feel like we had to walk on eggshells, which allowed my husband and I to enjoy our time there.\nWe just want to go to karaoke where the KJ is decent!

That said, they all seem to mesh and the vibe is nothing but positive every evening. I mean, what more could you ask for...old salts and college karaoke kids, epic.\n\nI recently bellied up at the bar during the happy hour window and found myself in some pleasant golf conversation as the Farmers Insurance Open was going on in Torrey Pines that weekend. The old timers welcomed me in with open arms while I sipped on my $4 dollar Coors light bottles and we had a lovely convo about the \"good ol days\". Check this place out if you love dive bars and friendly peeps, it's still one of my favorites.",

Otherwise I visit a couple of the restaurants.  I pass by The Lamplighter with its metal sign of a lamplighter.  Haven't been back since ages ago.\n\nWell, surprise surprise, this place looks good. Dive bars are often found in areas of San Diego and slowly disappearing (Tobacco Rhoda's for example).  The Lamplighter is an old neighborhood bar with NFL games during the summer/fall.  I haven't been in there since the remodel and I was pleasantly surprised on how it looks now.  I would say I might visit more often especially for Karaoke night.\n\nCash Only but they have an ATM machine in there.  If you go to US Bank/Wells Fargp, its only a block away.  I definitely felt that this might be my new go to bar with friends when I just want to hang out and watch a game or sing my heart out (karaoke starts after 9 - check on their profile for more info on when this occurs, I am not sure if its everyday).  \n\nWell Mission Hills is beginning to be the best neighborhood in San Diego, yeah even better than Hillcrest!",

I could imagine, during the days of nicotine allowance, this place would of provided a haziness about it as well.\n\nNevertheless, whether it is a dive or classic bar, they serve some inexpensive draft beers, not to mention quite refreshing (yelp.com/biz_photos/the-\u2026), but I would suggest that they served their drafts beers in a ice cold glass mug rather a warm one, so that the beer would better host its coldness. Other than that, I had a very nice bar maid and some nice conversation with the locals.\n\nThey do offer karaoke during the evenings and you can order food delivers from a list of local eateries. That's always a nice benefit...\nYou know you want....",

Right as we were walking in my shoe got caught a little and slipped off and the security guard laughed which is fine I can laugh at myself too; I was silly and clumsy. But then I asked how his night was going and he responded \"I'm doing better than you\". Lol there are so many things wrong with this statement but I'll leave it at \"you're the one working bro, I think I'm doing a little bit better than you\". Then as we order drinks the guy says it's cash only, but the atm charges $4 just to get money out. Total scheme. The bartenders in general are unfriendly and the karaoke woman was extremely unfriendly. I am no amateur to karaoke and she was really rude when I said it was my first time here and I just wanted to now how many singers until I was up. She texted for a minute; looked at the screen and then said to me \"a few songs\". Thanks for taking time from your busy texting schedule to do your job and respond to me. The only thing that got this review from a 3 to a 4 is the fact they offered a free drink to me after I sang because I sang so well. But the bartender sounded so annoyed that he had to offer it to me. So in general I'd say if you're a karaoke lover and you're on vacay give it this place a stop and sing( DO IT EARLY) and then by god get the f out or you'll become infected with the nasty vibes that fill this place.\nUseful 1\nFunny 1\nCool 1\n8/18/2018Previous review",

Arrived at 10:30pm and stayed til 1:45 and no song.  Maybe it's because we are a group of African American women. This place showed no love to us. It's truly sad because we really like karaoke and thought this establishment would be welcoming. Guess not. Never will we go back. \u200d Don't waste time here.",

I had to pay between 20 and $40 tip although I was the singer who made my living at singing for 30 years a retired contractor now I find this appalling. There were good singers who got treated badly.. the only criteria for this established it's how much you put in the tip jar... you have to pay $3.75 to use an ATM since I built bars in the Gaslamp for the last 20 years the only reason you would do that is to hide your cash it's too bad a place that has a very good sound system can operate legitimately",

The Lamplighter features nightly karaoke starting at 9 or 9ish and has a great juke box as well. The bar is a classic dive with character and history. The bathrooms are grungy and the floor is filthy but it is all part of the scene! The Lamplighter is a \"cash only\" bar, but you won't find more modest prices for drinks in this area. Great place to go with friends for the evening or a cocktail with your date after dinner. Check it out!\n\n4.5 Stars.",

You might be the best karaoke bar in town maybe BUT you need to work on your karaoke MC. I've been to the lamplighter multiple times and the lady MC has been great. However tonight we had a guy MC and watch on multiple occasions people pay the MC to cut the line. I get it everyone wants to sign their song within a reasonable time but don't cheat the system.\n\nAside from that, good dive bar to venture to for a fun karaoke night out. Plenty of booths to sit down but most of the booths up front by karaoke stage get taken up quick. Bar is cash only so definitely go to the ATM before hand or pay the ATM charge to withdraw $$. $5 Cover occurs after 9 ish",

So basically all I'm saying is that the Lamplighter is a cut above every other bar I've been to in any major city, and let me tell you, I've blacked out in more major cities than Charlie sheen.",

While the Lamplighter is a piece of San Diego history (it opened in 1957), they've continued to cater to the San Diego community. They have a small, yet solid, selection of craft beers on tap.\n\nThey've done some work to have a clearly defined karaoke stage, but the selection of songs is a bit dated, just like this bar is.\n\nRandom fact: They're open 365 days a year, and they serve every operating hour it's legal to do so in San Diego (6AM through 2AM... daily).\n\nPROPS: Lamplighter offers a consistent dive bar/karaoke experience. You know exactly what you're getting when you come here.\nSLOPS: It's an old school dive bar where you can't use your credit card.",

I called to reserve a table on Monday and Wednesday but never received a callback. I decided to call Friday, the night I planned on bringing seven people with me(which was last night) fortunately, the owner gave me a callback and reassured me that he would have seating for all my guests. When I arrived around 7:45 pm, the place was pretty empty. As the time approached for karaoke to begin at 9 PM, people started to trickle in . I put my name on the song list early and also reserved another spot for karaoke for my friend. The DJ was very friendly. Actually, I bought him a beer. They were trying a new karaoke system on the computer so they were a couple glitches but there always was two or three people ready to solve any problems that would arise. I thought the bartenders and the staff worked really hard throughout the night. It did get really busy and the place was filled with a lot of people. A lot of karaoke bars, people sit and just sing along with the people that butcher the lyrics. At this place, people actually dance and sing along with the karaoke participants. I thought this place was a lot of fun and so did my entire group. We only planned to stay till midnight but we stayed until 1:30am. Bring cash because it is cash only and they do not take credit/debit cards. Overall, it is a very live atmosphere and I think the staff really care about people having a good time. I would recommend anyone to try the Lamplighter because you will sing and dance the night away.",

I understand a popular bar operating as such however after arriving at 9pm I would have thought that within an hour or so - someone from within our clan would sing one song. This never occurred by 1am. Not even one person. We checked with the Karaoke girl several times. Every time she told us \"20\" people were in front of us. Finally after waiting 3 1/5 hours we gave up and left. I am not a local but our family that lives here was really hoping we would stay for an experience we never got.",

A few years ago with a group of friends, it was a random place to try a group number and get a couple drinks. Most recently, a visitor to SD heard about the place and wanted to check it out. The place seemed to be much more packed than I last remembered. It's dark inside, thus shady. After walking through the place, I noticed A LOT of people needed to get a room. I wouldn't try sitting on or even touching any of the surfaces.\n\nThe wait for a song was crazy long and we didn't end up staying longer than 5 minutes. Though divey, the Lamplighter can be a \"come one, come all\" kind of atmosphere for some who are out partying with a crowd.",

                  "review": "To be fair, Lamplighter was our go-to end of the night spot after we were already good and drunk. It was a fun dive bar where we could sing along and enjoy some sometimes good, sometimes God awful karaoke singers. Plus it was a quick drunk mosey back to the apartment, often via a late night burrito place.  It is important to note that Lamplighter is also disgusting. Like don't touch anything, don't drink out of their cups levels of gross. Yet we still returned almost every weekend.\n\nHowever, a few months ago Lamplighter got a new bouncer who is a complete tool and who charges cover. They've NEVER had cover previously and their website still boasts no cover with loads of exclamation points. Actually, I shall copy and paste it for you all: \"!!!!!!!NO COVER!!!!!!!\" This is a lie. We emailed the bar about this and got no response, and we asked the bouncer about the website and he just told us it needed to be updated. Then update it already! We've gone back a few times now to be sure it wasn't a fluke cover night, but sure enough he was there wanting cover. And we're talking about wanting cover at 130am. Like seriously bro? It's almost last call. Hell no. Lamplighter is the kind of dive that should pay YOU to come inside. Or just be free like it was.\n\nThe first time we saw this new bouncer, he was immediately combative and tried to tell us they've ALWAYS had cover, and that we were being crazy. We've been regulars for 2.5 years jerkwad, and have never once paid cover. Also if cover is new, why not just say so and not be a dick about it? Did you ever think of that? I have a sad feeling this guy is going to cause the Lighter to lose a lot of regulars. I also suspect that maybe there really is no cover and this jerk is just pocketing the money. Another time he offered us $20 for our group of 6. Yeeeah thanks, but it's still 1245am and you just proved that the cover is completely an arbitrary amount. And it's still not worth my $3.33. Bye!\n\nBottom line: If you want to do karaoke and have never been there, sure pay your $5 and check it out. For me, knowing what Lamplighter offers, my friends and I will not be back unless the cover is gone. Such a pity because we did enjoy the casual atmosphere.\n\n2 stars for the memories, but low scores for the rude bouncer, sticky floors, a weird smell I used to be able to overlook with free entry, and for not being able to make a good rum and coke. It's rum and coke you guys.",

Yes, the drinks were stiff and cheap - $5 for beer and wine and $8 Premium Liquor. Mixed crowd, but becomes younger as the night goes on. Cash only - always wondered about cash only and what gets reported and what doesn't.\n\nThe Karaoke part was lame. There was some girl running Karaoke at the stage. Unlike other Karaoke places where the host acts like DJ - she acted like some girl playing music from her computer at home - no commentary, no personality, nada.\n\nThis place looks to be a place for regulars. Decent singers, including a couple rapper wannabes (yes, we know you practice in your bedroom at night) and a really good country singer along with your requisite drunk 20 something. My friends and I never got to karaoke (we think the host only chose the regulars she knew) so we left.\n\nThere are places that host better karaoke so I am going to try those next.",

This place is known for it's karaoke even though I think there are much better dive bar karaoke options out there. Want to sing your song faster? You have to grease up the host with a few bucks since they clearly play favorites and you don't stand a chance of getting up quickly against their regulars. Lame.\n\nA quick gripe... so my name is Brad, obvi. Because of this my friends call me lots of nicknames, but most often B-Rad or BeeRadLee. I don't do this to myself, it just happens.\n\nSo on a past visit I was thrown under the bus when some friends signed me up to sing without my knowledge. I'm not opposed to it but just had no idea that I should be preparing for a performance. When I finally made it to the top of the list I heard this from the KJ: \"Next up is... okay, I almost refuse to call you by this name. Seriously dude, you're going to call yourself B-Rad?! That's lame. Come on up, bro. Better be good.\"\n\nRelax, Tiger! You're pushing buttons on a laptop at a dive bar. Don't take yourself so seriously. Let us get in there, tip our bartenders and bribe you with a few bucks to sing a song or two. Don't disrespect the crowd and let the \"power\" go to your head. We appreciate you, you may not like us but just shut your mouth, play \"Nothing Compares 2U\" by Sinead O'Conner and do your job. We'll enjoy our cheap stiff drinks and everyone will be happy. Deal?",

In fact, I just don't go to dive bars, I wouldn't even yelp dive bars, only upscale hotel or gastro bars for me, now I sound so spoiled again....\n\nLocated in Mission Hills, this place is tiny and old, with a bar, pool table, juke box, karaoke and tiny dance floor and stage, cash only, they have ATM machine inside. The drinks were so cheap, a Grey Goose cocktail and a tap beer only cost $13?! I was so surprised!\n\nFriend says this place is always packed on weekends. Lots of ppl went up and sing their hearts out, regardless if they rocked or sucked. But everybody was having such a great time, a lot of dancing and singing, it was really fun to watch and sip on my drinks!\n\nA very different scene from the places I usually go, but I liked it, I am glad my good friend took us to this casual local karaoke and dive bar, good times!  \n\nPs. Lots of street parkings nearby. And the restroom was surprisingly clean!",

Needless to say, once you start to befriend all of the locals here this place can actually be pretty fun. My buddy and I proceeded to earn the local's respect by locking down the pool table virtually all night and creating some healthy competition. Overall, this place was jam packed with a diverse crowd, karaoke was blasting and the bottles of Budweiser was flowing all night. This isn't generally my type of place but I do recommend occasionally getting it out of your system by grabbing a Budweiser and enjoying your night.\n\nPros-\nThe karaoke singers were actually good\nCheap\nRespectable crowd\nPool table\nLocation\nStiff drinks\n\nCons-\nParking stinks\nCash only\nPlace kinda smells\nOutdated",

The DJ sucked and played regular songs in between each kareoke singer which made for a loooooonnngggggg night. We got there at 10 signed in at left at 1230 with a ton of people ahead of us still.. What a waste! The place is extremely small and you will have sweaty people bumping into you. Decent mix of people but I don't recommend unless you live close or don't mind the DJ not going through the list of singers quickly.",

It's a great place and justifiably gets 5 star ratings from a lot of people, but this bar is rarely my cup of tea.  I came here on a Saturday night most recently.  It's packed.\n\nUsually this place has that old bowling alley shoe smell, but last night only half the bar smelled like old bowling alley shoes.  The other half smelled like puke.  Fortunately, the puke side wasn't the side with the karaoke screen and dance floor last night.  The thing I dislike most about this place is that it is a cash only bar.  \n\nThis all said, if you're even open to listening to Karaoke, you'll have a blast here!  You get to watch people make fools of themselves and sing along to all your favorite songs from Dean Martin to Drake.  Some of the karaoke-ers here are awesome singers.  If you want to sing, you better get here early or pay the DJ, otherwise your name and song won't get called for hours.\n\nThe drinks here are not cheap for a karaoke dive bar, but you get more than your money's worth with stiff cocktails.  Finally, you'll find pretty much every age group over 21 here.\n\nUltimately, if you love karaoke, you have to come here because it's the best karaoke bar in San Diego and you'll love it!  You'll probably give it 5 stars.  If karaoke does not do it for you, you may get excited when an NSYNC song comes on, but you'll mostly want to go get a tetanus shot.\nBar\nKaraoke stage and dance floor",

Lamp is the best upbeat dive in San Diego.  It's upbeat but not pretentious....a hard feat for a bar.  Come with a group of friends and sing-along or dance to the karaoke.  Most nights, the song selections are pretty upbeat!  \n\nNightly karaoke starts at 9/930 p.m.  Lamp is great for groups and parties.  On weekends, you'll always see at least one birthday or bachelorette party.  It's always busy but rarely annoyingly crowded.  \n\nThey have pool tables, reasonably priced drinks and a clean restroom.  The bartenders are nice and efficient!  I've never waited more than two-three mins to get a drink.  They also have servers on the weekends.  Only gripe is that it's cash only...  \n\nMy advice?  Come early!  Walking in to karaoke and crowds at midnight could be annoying, but come at 9 or 10 p.m. to get a couple of drinks before it really picks up.  It can get loud, especially at the high-top tables by the karaoke.  Know what you are in for and you'll have a blast.",

Why?\n1. This business could easily make double what they are making off the drinks by having bartenders that have some sense of urgency, I have never seen a bartender move so slow on a busy night.\n2. The bartenders literally make 1 drink at a time, they should be competent enough to make 4-5 drinks at once.\n3. They should be acknowledging customers and letting them know they will be right with them.\n4. They should be personable and make customers want to come back.\n\nEvery customer there was complaining about how slow and rude the bartenders are. Even one local who claims she's there regularly because she lives close by said that she normally refuses to come on fridays or Saturday's because the bartenders don't even try to serve drinks, they take there time as if there's only 3 customers in the bar.",

I live downtown, and it's nice to get away from the weekend downtown crowd, and come to The Lamplighter where the crowd is diverse, drama and dbag free, and always tons of fun. As far as KJ'S go, Stephanie and the famous Karaoke Jesus ( A.K.A. Wes) are the best! Super friendly and they handle the crowd really well. Joe and J.J. at the bar make great drinks, and they also have one of the coolest bouncers I've met. All in all, if you're looking for a fun night, a few drinks, and a great crowd, this is your place.\nHaving a blast as usual!",

The person complaining about the owner, and the \"new\" pool table rules... Was stumbling drunk, and decided that THEIR rule for the pool table is: \" we keep playing until we lose!\"...

The drinks are cheap (and strong), the song selection is superb, and there are stools and tables for you and your posse to hang out at.\n\nHeads up!  It's cash only, so bring some unless you wanna use their atm and pay a fee!  And I guess parking can be a pain, but my homie lives a block away so it's never a problem for us.  (muhahaa)  Otherwise, I recommend using Lyft or Uber because you're gonna get wasted here anyway and eat at that Mexican joint down the street.\n\nIf you don't mind drunk people and your group loves to sing, I highly recommend hanging out here.  It's low key, you don't need to dress up, and the people are obnoxious just like you.  Let loose and have fun!  Don't be boring and not sing.  You HAVE to sing.",

Parking in the area is street parking only and depending on the night you may be parking a block or 2 away. Like I mentioned this is a Locals spot not many san diegans from adjacent towns seem to travel here for a drink...ill leave the perception of it being a good bar up to you",

MacKenzie and Steph make sure that everyone gets to sing.  They make it sound great as your voice fills the room and gets everyone motivated to get on the dance floor.\n\nBTW,  As a note be patient while awaiting your name to be called for Karaoke.  There are many people who want to sing.  Please be kind to the Ladies who run the Karaoke and bring you your drinks.  This is like family.  \nBe respectful..\n\nMichelle is so fast and efficient.  She will have your drink back to you faster than you can walk to the restroom.  Seriously. When the bar is full to capacity on almost every Friday and Saturday you get your drinks way faster than almost any other bar around.  \n\nI love this place.

He wouldn't stop lingering at the pool table and loudly observing our game, so I asked him to take it down a notch. He then proceeded to curse at me and use degrading words toward me, and then threatened my friends and I (all women), saying that he would have his friend \"meet us in the alley\" on our way out. Obviously, this was a super scary situation so we told the bartender, who then proceeded to inform us that the guy was a regular and that he didn't mean anything by it. Translation: They didn't kick him out because he spends a lot of money there. Lamplighter does not care about the personal safety of its customers, let alone serving you quickly at the bar.

I mainly came for the karaoke and was a little nervous to go up and sing, but everyone in this bar was so fun and encouraging it took away my stage freight! The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the two drinks I ordered had vodka, and it must have been really cheap vodka because I got EXTREMELY sick. I've never gotten sick like that :( If I come back, I'll be sure to stick with beer or no drinks at all.",

There is NO waiter service, you have to fight for a bar spot to order and there is NO MANAGEMENT, I asked for a manager and I was told they don't have one.  SERIOUSLY.  Plus they allow people to get so drunk that they cause scenes but there is no one there to keep it in check.\n\nOn a side note:  from previous reviewers I didn't notice any security and the KJ went down the line on her list for singers.  I never saw money exchange hands and her tip jar was fairly empty.  I know this because I had to practically sit on her lap there was no where else to stand.\n\nUm yeah, I personally will not be back on a Saturday way too out of control.  Probably never.\n\nOh yeah and you better bring Cash because nothing else is good here, yes they have an ATM but be warned the fees there are high.  Drinks sucked too, couldn't make a decent martini if their life depended on it.",

We arrived around 10:30 and had already a song in mind, found quickly by the provided playlists, and placed in line on the sheet provided.  Drinks were ordered initially without any issue, however a quick return visit for a beverage felt like I was a ghost as I watched the bartender overlook me over four other people at a very open bar, including an in-between time with his phone for a text or two, the fourth person is where I promptly interjected my presence capturing his attention as he finished with that last customer.  12:30am arrives and my song, Santeria by Sublime, im still waiting for my name, now, I realize they mention no guarantees, but who does not wanna here Sublime?!!  The only allure of a possible return visit is a lively crowd and decent karaoke system.  Had it not been for the poor service, this place is actually deserving of four stars.",

I've been here twice and both visits were for birthdays that landed on a weekday, so it wasn't crowded at all.  They have a HUGE song book and almost every song I tried to look up was in there.  \n\nThe bartenders make pretty strong drinks, so it's usually a pretty good value even if they don't have specials all the time.  $20 for two Stellas and two Irish Car Bombs.  Oh, and it's CASH ONLY (which I strongly dislike, so I'm deducting a star).  \n\nPool table and darts also available in case you're not a karaoke fan either.",

But today, it's Christmas, and again I find myself thirsty in mission hills with one of my lady friends. She lives here, loves this bar and the folks who drink here. Shortly after sunset we walk on down for a few drinks.\n\nSarah is the bartender and she's lovely. All smiles, fun music choices, we make friends and settle in. The Lamplighter is a comfy dive during the day without the karaoke crowd. A very different scene and we enjoyed it very much.\n\nUntil Jay, the owners son, showed up. I'm guessing Santa brought him a big lump of coal and the snow he was playing in must have been yellow because, he saw my friend and tore into her pretty good. Said we were 86'd because of the review I wrote about their extortionist kj and cocktail waitress who shoved me. I asked the bartender, Sarah, if we had been good customers, she said yes and would be glad to tell Jay the same.\n\nIn the end, it didn't matter. We overpaid for our drinks because no one would provide me with my tab, and I've been inspired to write yet another review about an unfortunately horrible expedience at this bar. I thought we would have a better experience without the karaoke but, turns out, The Lamplighter doesn't believe that happy, repeat neighborhood customers are good for businesses.\n\non a side note, drugs are bad.",

The Bouncer was well... like a bouncer. Old guy, crew cut, looks like he can handle himself (not that I was going to try anything... just saying). At the bar I noticed sometihng... my feet were sticking to the carpet. ok HOLD the PHONE! When the feets stick el carpet, it's time to clean because there are probably some undiscovered life forms down there and i'm killing them. And that's not copasetic. Come on LL, you can do better than that and i'm sure I alone drank enough for you to afford Stanly Steamer.\n\nOn to the crowd. It wasn't too bad. Granted I didn't notice the old lady groping me. Probably because I was smashed against people trying to move 10 feet. What can I say, this is a populat watering hole for the singers and drunken song butchers in all of us. The place is pack on saturday so take that into consideration before heading down. If you don't like tight spaces, come back another day because something tells me that old lady will be there next saturday... hands at the ready.\n\nNow for the bar service. One word. TERRIBLE! Save most of your drinking for somewhere else. Yep, I said it and I hope they read it! My bartender made a 5 dollar drink and didn't have the common courtesy to check the tip I gave him. Who tips 10.00 on a 5 dollar drink. And when I addressed the fact that I gave him the wrong bill he couldn't hear me all of a sudden. But he heard me when I ordered my next drink. he didn't get another tip that night. My waitress was cool. Even with the packed crowd she navigated and handled the work load like a champ. Oh, I almost forgot... back to the bartender. I asked for a Sexy Alligator (great drink) but what he made was something that could have been used to induce vomiting. Absolutely terrible. For a moment I thought my night had met it's end with that shot. Yuck.\n\nUsually the Dj's get a tough deal in Karaoke bars but that night the DJ was awesome. He was cool. He's the reason for the 3rd star. So in conclusion. Upkeep is abismal, bartending service is horrific, crowd is ok (just watchout for the occasional groping), Dj cool, waitresses cool. Next b-day... I may go to Gillys.",

As a Karaoke Bar its fairly fun, however on a personal note, I was thrown out of the bar for \"not paying my tab.\" My tab being the two drinks I bought, totaling 16 dollars for which I paid a 20 and left the change. Apparently when the bartender sees someone not paying their tab, they tell the bouncer the gender and the shirt color of the offender. This being the case I was subsequently stuck outside for about 30 minutes with no phone or wallet as I had left those with my girlfriend... inside...\nI have never been so offended before.",

When i asked for my drinks he had a really pompous attitude to him. When i got my drinks he looked at me and overcharged me, i knew he did cause i was buying drinks all night from the other bartender who was pleasant.

It was packed, and unless you get there ridonkulously early, you apparently have no shot at singing. That is, unless you shamelessly ask the girl singing alone on stage if she'd like back up dancers. Of course, she said yes. Who would be so rude as to deny such a request? Probably the same people who would be so rude as to intrude on someone's 15 minutes on stage at The Lamplighter. Thankfully, it was not us who were being asked this question. So, we hopped on stage and did our thang. Now here's where my story differs from my coworker's. Here's my side: the girl who was singing handed me her mike at some point. I'm thinking, \"Oh, you don't want to sing anymore? Weird. But, I'll take it.\" So my coworkers and I flexed our vocal chords and kept the tunes going. Then, the karaoke peeps handed the girl another mike and we all sang together. Now here's my coworker's story that came out when we re-hashed the next day: I allegedly grabbed the mike out of the girl's hand. Then the karaoke peeps handed her another mike and turned ours off.\n\nKey word, allegedly.",

It may seem intimidating from the outside with some people just loitering around the entrance...but they're just loitering or going for a smoke break, but inside, seemed like a bar for everyone. It may not be the fanciest of bars, but you'll probably still have a great time here.\n\nFootball, baseball, horse racing, karaoke and booze, booze and more booze.  Went with my usual drink....rum and pineapple. You're going to need some water to compliment your well drink because they serve their drinks here, pretty stiff. It was like 8 parts alcohol, 1 part juice. Cheap too, somewhere in the $4 range. So you get the most bang out of your buck here at this place.\n\nLot of people when I came in this particular evening, probably 100+ or more, so it kinda smelled like feet and ass, but eventually you got used to the smell.\n\nGreat music, strong drinks, great karaoke, horse racing for me, great times here.",

I haven't been there during karaoke and I don't intend to but I am sure I will stumble in there one night.\n\nI prefer to go in there after a solid night of drinking to prevent severe side effects.  Bloddies are $2.50 each and are tasty.  Although they open daily at 6 am, i usually stumble in between 10 and 11 and start the cycle all over again.  The Huddle is accross the street and you can order any of their breakfast goodness and they deliver it right to your bar stool.  Just ask for the menus and the bar tender calls your order in (I always get a ham, egg, and cheese bagle).  Leftys starts delivering subs or slices around noon and delivers as well.  I have been in there by myself many times and always make a new friend or two.  There are \"regulars\" there and if I wasnt in Afghanistan right now, I'd be one of them.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n11/2/2009Previous review\nThey open at 6 a.m!!!!  I will be going here every day before work to get my fix....just kidding, I am NOT an alcoholic...\n\nBut if YOU are, this is one of few places in the area that you can get a cocktail before 10 or 11 and you probably already knew that.  If your like me and need a bloody mary shortly after waking from a long night of boozing in order to not feel like baa-cock  the next day, this is the place for you.  You can even order breakfast from a place across the street and they deliver it to you.  What more can a girl ask for?  Lots more and not getting ripped off is one of those things.  $5 for two bloodies is my definition of not getting ripped off.",

However, it's known for its Karaoke, and, unless you're just going to watch/listen or you're willing to constantly bribe the KJs, you're going to be in for a very frustrating experience.\n\nThe KJs are either incapable of basic fairness or incapable of calling singers up in the order they filled out the list, or both. My latest experience:\n\nI sign up, review the list, and take note that it'll be 12 songs before I'm called. 18 songs later I check with the list/KJ, she points to the list and tells me \"5 more songs and your up.\" 8 songs later I check with her again, she tells me, \"three more songs and you're up.\" 5 songs later I check with her again, she tells me \"a couple more songs and you're up.\" I finally told her to scratch my name off the list because I was tired of getting lied to and waiting three hours to sing one song.\n\nDuring the wait I watched a few people sing multiple songs -- one very energetic/entertaining guy sang four songs. If the KJ doesn't like your song, doesn't think you're entertaining enough, or you haven't paid her off sufficiently, they'll never tell you so -- they'll just string you along and you'll never get called up.",

The crowd mood was \"ready-to-dance.\" The cover music between singers was all dance-y stuff that primed the customers to do just that. I took the hint, did \"Jump in the Line,\" the patrons whooped and did a conga line. Smiles and high-fives from them. Four minutes of ego-gratifying pseudo-rock-stardom for me. drinks reasonable.

Always a good place to sing karaoke and my friends and I consistently have a good time. Prepare yourself for performances that will make you laugh, make you cry, or maybe just cringe.\n\nLast time I came here I wasn't drinking, but I remember one experience involving a blueberry vodka tonic that threw me for a loop.\n\nI like that we can always find parking easily, makes the night out a little less stressful.",

No more \"Look over there!!\" and then dashing for the front door.

And possibly accidentally resulted in the circumstances that prompted Agreement #2.\n\nI must admit that I love me some Long Island Iced Tea as well, although not the way that Lamplighter makes them, with too much lemony flavour, and not enough balance.  It was like paint thinner that had been waved over coke.  Yick.\n\nBut with that out of the way, let's start on the awesomeness that is Lamplighter.  After getting dinner at a friend's birthday, we all chanced upon the Lamplighter for some karaoke and festivities.  If you get there early, as in around 9:30 pm on a Friday, you'll encounter a horde of crusty regulars, some of whom may come up to you, slap you on teh back and scream \"You've got crazy hair, motherfucker!\"  Or insist that you look **exactly** like Mike Brown, their buddy who came back from Vietnam in 1972, complete with afro and confused expression.\n\nBeing yelled at and compared to a returning Vietnam vet did facilitate the purchasing of second Tea from the Long Island, but I digress a bit again.\n\nWhile waiting for the karaoke to set up, I had a chance to look around the place and take in the joys of the Lamplighter. It definitely fits the divebar standard, with the wood paneling, the haphazard decoration, the janky ATM machine, the dim lighting, the requisite pool table, and the cash only rule.  \n\nThe karaoke itself was delightful.  Multiple teas did convince me that perhaps I'd sing a duet of \"Beauty and the Beast,\" because apparently after a few beverages, your white female friend thinks she's Celine Dion and apparently needs a Peabo Bryson.  And then it seemed a good idea to do \"Ride Wit Me\".  There is something ridiculously wrong about wearing your preppy Old Navy sweater and then getting up to perform a 2001 rap song.  It *might* work if you're Kanye West.  It doesn't if you look like this: static.px.yelp.com/photo\u2026\n\nDon't judge me too harshly.\n\nAnyway, the stiff drinks, the lively crowd, and the karaoke were a pretty fun way to spend the night.  However, two additional caveats: the ATM machine charges $3.50 to make a transaction (robbery, i tell you!), and the place fills up rapidly by 10:30, 11, so keep it in mind.\n\nThanks Lamplighter.  Now if you just made better Long Islands, we'd be set.",

The bartenders Petey and especially Russ are great, Mitchell who runs the karaoke machine thingie is awesome, the crowd on Sunday is almost always great (except on holiday weekends when there is a cover all of a sudden and the place is packed). I don't go there as much as I used to because of my ever-changing work schedule, but I can always count on friendly faces to be there if I show up randomly on a Sunday night.\n\nThe drinks are good and cheap. Russ likes to make up experimental shots and use us as guinea pigs to try them out. It's completely a dive, the bathrooms suck, and seats can be tight, but it's always fun and you'll usually see some pretty odd characters. I've seen people fight, I've seen karaoke DJs come and go, I've even seen a lady strip (pretty sure she was homeless). My crew is always fun and we sometimes have birthday parties there or random theme nights. Come on a Sunday and have a good time!",

If you play quarters, Big John will def. throw down with you @ the front door.  He is cool as hell.  He also does enjoy getting a pizza also with thin crust, pep, mush and sausage.   NO ONIONS!!!!\n\nDrinks here are stiff and cheap, and for the single men, my good friends who got me hooked on this place said there is an 80% chance of going home with a chic when you come here.   I personally think girls come here to A) Have fun, B) Find a suitor for the evening.\n\nA couple of my ex's frequent this place as well.

                  "review": "It sounds like not much has changed at this place. We went here last night with some younger friends who wanted to go to a karaoke bar.  We were warned ahead of time not to expect too much from this place so we weren't terrible disappointed.  I guess I'll have to check out my friend's review later to see how pissed he was.  Anyway, the peeps we went with were regular enough that we got in the front door with little hassle (or cover charge) which was nice.  I guess our friends were thinking they could use the cover money to bribe the KJ.  No such luck.\n\nThe place was really hopping which is good for a Saturday night in Mission Hills.  It was really packed inside and literally standing room only.  The bar was lined with patrons and the pool table was being used continuously.  The hallmark of this place, however, is their karaoke.  We showed up around 930PM and my friend promptly put his name on the list.  We then proceeded to stand around til 1AM waiting for his name to be called.  Yes, he did tip the KJ.  This is another name for bribe but hey, the guy has to eat too.  Some singers weren't half bad but most were pretty crappy.  Still the audience standing around was pretty kind and generally went along with whoever was on stage no matter how bad they were.  I never did find out just how it was up on stage but in the back the acoustics were so bad and the music was so loud I couldn't hear whether I sounded good or bad as I sang along.\n\nBack to the issue with this place-in spite of the fact that my friend knew the bouncer and the bartender and he tipped the KJ, after 3 1/2 hours we left without having had a chance to get to the stage.  It might not have been so bad except for the fact that I can tell you that the same people got up 2 and 3 times to sing during the time we were there.  That's just not cool.  I heard the previous KJ was replaced for similar practices.  If so, this dude ain't long for the job either.  I personally didn't care that I never got a chance to sing but my buddy who paid his bribe and waited patiently was pretty pissed-with good reason.\n\nAside from the karaoke issue, I had no problems with the place.   I've been to dingier bars in my time and kind of prefer the lower-end ones anyway.  Seeing as how we got shut out at the karaoke machine I'm really glad the bouncer let the cover slide.  If we had paid the cover I think I would have demanded a refund.  I can't think of what else one would pay cover for at this place.  I only had one beer since I had polished off a nice martini and some wine at dinner next door but it was cold and tasted good.  Anyway, I had heard about this place for years and now I tried it.",

I think it's fair to round up, so here we are.\n\nLamplighter is fun. Seriously, you'll have a hard time not having a great time. The bartenders are always nice, and super-efficient at dealing with the crazy crowds, and drink prices are average--$5 for a gin 'n' tonic.\n\nThe karaoke is fun, but good luck getting any chance to sing. Karaoke is supposed to be free, but it seems the only way your name will get called is if you grease the KJ! Sorry, I'm all for tipping, but I don't think I should have to pay to sing karaoke... and it's a bit annoying to see the same two or three people singing over and over and over and over again. Some of them take their karaoke a BIT too seriously... guys, I can GUARANTEE YOU Simon Cowell is not in the audience, so chillax and sit one out.",

The bartenders are so nice and pour great, cheap drinks.  I had 2 GOOD rum and cokes for $10.  And when I say good I mean rum with a splash of coke and good night!\n\nThe song collection is great.  I just wish they would limit how many times \"Piano Man\" is sung in one night.  And you shouldn't be allowed to do \"A Boy Named Sue\" unless you really know it.  Otherwise, you're just making Mr. Cash roll over in his grave and that's not nice(RIP Johnny).  I've done Baby Got Back twice.  Cause that's how I roll.\n\nInteresting folk gather and perform here.  A man dressed like David Bowie, singing Bowie songs but jumping around like David Lee Roth.  A middle-aged woman dancing Carlton from Fresh Prince-style barefoot.  And the middle-aged men who think they got game.\n\nI have to agree with the other yelpers who say it's pick-up central.  But how many times can you really use the line \"Hey, GREAT performance!  Can I repay the favor and sing for you sometime?\"",

I'm a good kareokier...I get high fives, people dancing and singing along and even the occaisional groupie. I sing fun 80's songs that get the crowd going and bring a good sized group of singers with me each time. I even dropped a $20 into his tip jar and made friendly conversation each time.... but still waited 2 hours to get called up. All the while he keeps calling up the same dudes singing counting crows ballads  that aren there every time I go!  People were even requesting me- but still no dice.\n\nI am not alone in this. Another group of girls in the bathroom were complaining about the same thing. You can literally wait 3 or 4 hours to called up for your first song! One time he called up everybody on 2 pages of lists except my friends- and I tipped him and kept asking about it! I guess you have to be a regular or something to get a chance to sing?\n\nI'm not sure what stick is up that guy's ass- but the owners of the lamplighter should pull it out.

I knew pretty much what I was getting into, but...\n\nWe walked in the door and it reeked of FEET!  There were only about 10 people in the bar when we showed up.  We stayed for about an hour and a half and the smell never disappeared.  \n\nSome of the lights are busted, some of the seats have springs that will poke you in weird places.  \n\nThe karaoke?  Well, the sound system still sucks in a inconsistent way - meaning sometimes you can barely hear the person, other times they are way too loud.  The KJ looks like all the soul has been sucked out of him.  He didn't crack a smile once - except when he was laughing at his own jokes, supposedly.   I'm not 100% sure what he was saying, because the sound was so bad, I couldn't understand him.  Or, maybe he was just already on his 6th or 7th Miller Lite.\nUseful 4\nFunny 3\nCool 3\n7/1/2008Previous review\nI came here when I first visited SD in 2005, and have been back an handful of times since.  You have to understand, I'm a karaoke junkie. I love to sing, always have.  So give me a venue and I'll do it up!  \n\nI've been here a few times where it has gotten absolutely packed, and other times where it has been pretty dead.  The bartenders are okay - not terribly friendly, and tend to look at you and ignore you more than a few times.  But if you get their attention, you'll get your drink.  \n\nAs for the karaoke - the song selection is extensive, so that's a bonus.  However, one night that I went, the KJ was so drunk he kept calling the same people up after they'd just sung.  And bring up songs that they hadn't signed up for.  His vision must have been blurred from all the drinks he had.\n\nI've only been on weeknights, so I don't know what all this $5 cover  on the weekend biz is about, but if that's the case - sheeeesh.  That is ridiculous.  It's a neighborhood dive/karaoke bar.   It need not front like it is more than that and charge people like it's some fancy-pants hotspot.",

Like other reviewers I've been a sporadic patron for years. This place has everything you want from a hole-in-wall bar: cheap drinks, cheap entrance (when there is one), badly delivered music (not the songs themselves), diverse crowd and right next door to a liquor store to augment your state before or after the bar.\n\nThe only downside to the bar is that Thursday - Saturdays should be off limits to anyone arriving after 9:30pm. Why? Because you literally have to be one of the X-Men. That entails that have to transform your body into something mailable to squeeze through the  mass of people just to get a drink then navigate into a spot where you can stand and stretch your neck to peer over the stage.",

Lame since I'd been there since 7 PM.\n\nStill cash only. Drinks are cheap though still.. which is good. I didn't have a hard time getting a drink, but I sneaked in behind a chick, then this dude came up and pushed me aside and started cradling her. WTF I'm not trying to pick up on your middle-aged cougar! I just wanted a beer!\n\nYeah, place still sucks.\nUseful 4\nFunny 2\nCool 3\n7/24/2008Previous review\nTwo stars for the awesome karaoke selection.\n\nNo stars for the crowded, pretentiousness and difficulty getting a drink.\n\nBring cash because they don't accept credit cards and the ATM inside is expensive.\n\nIt's definitely a fun vibe if you're with a group of friends, but the karaoke list gets insane and even tipping a few bucks or more won't get you in any sooner. There are those regulars that come here and always seem to have the advantage in singing more songs. It's a bit frustrating at times. The first time I was there I put a song in about 10 PM and I was one of the last to sing over an hour later. I saw people who had gone already go up multiple times.",

I drink beer so don't know if they still pour stuff but I know back in the day they did. My big complaint is that we came here knowing that they're a karaoke bar. Four of us signed up to sign only to see the bar back go up three different times to sing and we never got our turn. Definitely a regular group so if you actually want to sing this might not be the place. Over all it was okay and the drinks and comical singers made it an okay night.",

And you can tell there are tons of karaoke regulars...so the music was fun to listen to. It's a little discouraging tho if you're hoping to sing. By the time we got there at 9:15, the DJ was on list 4 of sign-ups and only just making her way through list 1 at the time. Some of the bartenders were pretty rude as well.\n\nIt was my first time there, so I wasn't aware that it was a CASH ONLY place. Which is fine...I just didn't know when I ordered my beer. The bartender set it down, and when I handed him my card, he retracted from it like I was trying to hand him a poisonous snake. Then he gave me a really nasty look, and pointed to a sign that said \"Cash Only.\" Well, sheez - my bad dude, no need to shit your drawers over there. I told him I didn't have any cash on me. The next thing any normal person might do, might be to mention - \"hey no problem, there's an ATM literally two feet away from you\" not throw your arms up in the air like you could give a flying fuck and move on. My friends then directed me to the ATM (which had a $4 charge btw, so watch out :/ ) After I pulled out some cash, I came back to the bar to pay for my $5 yellow tail...which he had just left out on the bar (another thing I wasn't too thrilled about...since anyone could have done something to it had my friends not been right there). Not to mention, I'm sure I could have just swiped it and disappeared in to the crowd never to have been seen again, if I really wanted to, or anyone for that matter.\n\nLater, my friend put his money on the bar, asked that same bartender for a beer. He took his money. Grabbed his beer and told him the total was $5. We both looked at him puzzled...and told him that we had just given him $6 when we ordered. And then he gave us a look like we were trying to pull a fast one on him. WTF dude? Did you think that was a tip for your incredibly crappy service and charm????\n\nSo basically, no different from your average karaoke dive bar. Pretty much what I would expect. Fun to go with a group.",

It was a weekend, it sucked, we had a terrible time: The crowd and KJ were unbearable, but the songlist was vast, so we figure maybe a weekday will be worth it some day.\n\nNope. Back in San Diego for a wedding, and this place is horrible even on a Monday. Despite two bartenders it was a task to get a drink; I had to elbow in deep to get the attention of the one who wasn't trying to chat up a drunk girl. When I got my drink, it was pathetically under-liquored.\n\nThe worst of it (and the moment when I realized I've become a karaoke primadonna) was when I got called up, only to get called back down because the KJ couldn't find my song. On the one hand, he should have figured that out before calling me up. On the other, the song was Paint It Black, and I have serious doubts about any KJ who can't find that unassisted. Thirdly, he actually had it up on screen at one point, before rolling past it, looking bewildered, then telling me I'd written \"too many numbers.\" What I'd written was 26085ZM, which is exactly what was in the book. I guess he mistook my Z for a 2, and okay, whatever, but when you understand your own system so poorly that a mistake so simple can render you utterly helpless, it's time for me to walk out the door in a huff.\n\nAs I understand it, they charge a 5 dollar cover on weekends. The list of better ways to spend 5 dollars is very long and includes many activities of a masochistic nature, the imagination of which I shall leave as an exercise to the reader.",

Its cash only, but there is an ATM in the bar. It can get really crowded on the weekends... theres a few pool tables and a laid back crowd.\n\nThe bartenders will give you a good stiff drink and they open really early in the morning, so for those of us that work nights, going out after work in the morning is a good place. It's always full of old vets and hospital workers in the morning.",

                  "review": "Updated review\nNestled in the heart of the usually upscale Mission Hills area of San Diego lies The Lamplighter.  The Lamplighter is a destination Kareoke bar that moonlights as one of San Diego's bars that has the real potential to be an ACTUAL dive bar.\n\nFrom what I hear, getting a chance to sing here can be very very difficult, however the last time I went there was not much of a crowd so it seemed to not be too bad (it being a Tuesday helps I am sure).\n\nAside from the Kareoke Kraziness, the bar has reasonable prices.\n\nThe place has a certain dank odor (stench is far to strong) that lends itself well to the notion of dive.  It is, in my opinion, one of the saving graces of the place.  Not dirty, but certainly not clean.  The kind of place you can find some true authentic drinking at 8am without judgement or questions.\n\nThere is a rare beauty in that.\n\nOverall it is kinda average to most everyone because it opperates in two worlds and they are worlds that often are in opposition, so when people like one part (Kareoke or dinginess) they tend to not like the other.\nUseful 2\nFunny 1\nCool 2\n12/21/2008Previous review\nThere is something I am kinda a stickler on when going into bars.\n\nThat is the issue of cover charges.\n\nSo ... Lamplighter.  Midnight.  Slow night.  Cover charge?\n\nWHAT?\n\nTo go to a Kareoke bar?\n\nWhat?\n\nNo.\n\nGood drinks.\n\nNice atmosphere.",

                  "review": "\"You've never been to Lamplighter?!\"\n\nIf I had a dime for every time I heard this, I'd have at least two dimes.  The truth is that I've never really liked karaoke.  Shocking for someone who has repeatedly put together the most amazing cover acts EVER and is now a karaoke host.  When I got the idea to have a karaoke night that was really different, I actually had to go out to a few local karaoke spots to see what they were like because it'd been so long since I'd been to one.  I wasn't about to pay to research, so I skipped Lamplighter and once I started hosting I definitely didn't feel like goin out to a karaoke joint!\n\nSo I FINALLY went last night and got pretty much got exactly what I expected but it was actually better than I thought it'd be.  On everyone's advice, I made sure not to go on a weekend, so I missed out on the most-packed-bar-I-will-ever-be-in-ever and the insane waits to sing, unless your middle name is bribe.  It was a Monday night, early and mostly empty.  The setup is not what I thought it would be, at all, as far as where the stage faced and how much of the bar could see it.  Bartenders usually hate my Coke-orderin' ass but the guy was plenty nice and it was slow so I got served right away. (Russ, where were you?!)\n\nThere were basically three groups there singing.  \n1. Eric the host's friends, who were all amazing old school slow-jam experts (so was he!).  Sadly, my Jodeci knowledge isn't what it should be.\n2. A big, nice birthday group who exclusively sang Pour Some Love Shack type songs you hear at every karaoke place.\n3. Me & my wingman, who regretted choosing the Outfield to sing.\n\nI got some exercise lugging their 25,000 songbook over to our table.  Purist wingman wants a recount with all of the duplicate entries but I don't care.  It is definitely quality not quantity. Every popular song you'd expect in the most popular karaoke joint in town was there.  The only song I was surprised to see was Sparks' \"This Town Ain't Big Enough For The Both Of Us\", a ridiculous pre-Bohemian Rhapsody rock opera that would be sure to confuse any American karaoke audience.  So I sang it....not well.\n\nEnd result?! It was just fine!  I don't know if it's always that empty on weeknights but if I drank alcohol and wanted to sing any and every mainstream US hit from the last 40 years not far from where I live, well, I just might come here, if only to see the man who calls himself The Moondoggie, brings his own wireless mic to properly work the crowd and made a website about how rad he is.  Google him.  It'll change your life.",

                  "review": "I went on a Tuesday night, and there was no cover. Walking into the bar I was greeted with an unusual negative aroma that I couldn't place, but it was somewhere in the territory of wicked B.O. Thanks to living in a fraternity house for a few years my nose adapted quickly and it wasn't an issue any further. After having my ID checked, I discovered the bar was cash only. Predictably, the ATM has a $3.50 surcharge and I am certain it pays most of the bills.\n\nWhile a negative introduction, the place is cool. The booths are numerous, the decor achieves the authentic local San Diegan atmosphere, and the bartenders are attentive and the drinks are strong and inexpensive. We sat at a booth in the corner and people watched, and for a weekday night it was comfortably crowded. Aside from the bar and the booths, there's a pool table and, of course, the karaoke area.\n\nI went up to the DJ, who, I might add, is in the likeness of the late James Brown, and put in a request for my song. After a game of pool and a few drinks, I again approached him to ask when I'd be up. Instead of a time, he said that there was a tip jar. I put in a dollar and he said I was next. I couldn't help but laugh.\n\nI got up and spewed my rendition of Sublime's \"What I got\", and I asked some girls nearby to join in and help singing. I ended up with a small crowd helping me sing the song and it was good times. While I wouldn't suggest going on a Friday or Saturday night, for some weekday fun the Lamplighter delivers.",

And now a couple of things:\n\n1) To the guy who played Madonna's \"Music\" on the jukebox the first time I had been here all those years ago- Were you for real?  I'm not disputing the fact that Madonna is the O.G. Queen of pop, but even Madonna is sick of that song.  You need to put the cue stick down and pick another song.\n\n2) To the old pirate sitting at the bar trying to get me to smile-  Look, I love all of you old pirates, your alcoholism is what keeps the bar open.   But, you lose all of your magic when you open your mouth to speak.  Your job is to drown your sorrows and to think far away thoughts about your estranged family.

As the night wanes down, the girls bathroom becomes increasingly filled with vomit. Not yumm-o at all.\n\nThe KJ is a total Hitler. He's the main reason why this place isn't 5 stars. He won't play your songs unless you tip him 10 and over. Anna L. and I went there on a Friday night. I gave him 8 bucks and he never called our names. It was a damn good song too. 'Ive Had the Time of My Life'....a song remembered for a crucial scene in Dirty Dancing. Alas, I was shot down with my Swayzian ambitions because he ignored me like he owed me alimony or something.\n\nAfter that, my attitude towards the Lamplighter was very sour. Until our mutual friend invited us there on a Sunday. She insisted it was a totally different experience than the pain inducing Fridays and Saturdays. It was.\n\nUsually quiet. More attentive bartenders. A wise and fair KJ. Three people stand out to me there. JJ, the acerbic doorman, who apparently hosts karaoke there on Thursdays. Russ, the bartender with a velvety voice. And Mitchell, the KJ who plays your songs and will often do Morris Day and the Time's Bird dance.\n\nThey make the sunday nights fun.  Now, we go there almost every sunday. Last week, I did all TV theme songs. It was killer. The songbook has a lot of variety. I gotta love a place where I can get away with a song like 'Sweet Transvestite' in a bar half full of bros.

Bar is CASH only.\nI didn't pay a cover, but the doorman gave me a compliment or two, perhaps that was my charge.\n\nAs a 'tourist', it was bemusing and I could see it's purpose for the clientele & neighborhood.\n\nI'd go back for the people watching & off key Cee-lo again.",

Cheap drinks, cougars on the prowl, constant karaoke.\n\nSinging hilarity ensues....\n\nMore often than not, my friends and I end our weekend nights out at the Lamplighter.    I'm not sure if its the location which makes it a cheap cab to my pad at 2 am or the easy access to some heavy handed pours from the bartenders or my buddy Bob's delusions of vocal grandeur that bring us but we always have a lot of laughs there.  There are a few issues  of course.\na) It can get pretty crowded there.  Folks with personal space issues beware.\nb) It can get gross, the bathrooms are small and smelly.\nc)  There is always some white guy there for whom this place is his 15 meters of hip-hop fame.  He thinks himself quite the Tupac/Biggie/eZe.  Some nights that is amusing, mostly its just annoying.\n\nOther than that I enjoy the place.  It may have something to do with it being an \"end of the night\" place for me so I'm usually drunk when I get there thus I  am somewhat inured to the place's drawbacks.  It is a little bit of a dive and often I feel a little overdressed there after a night in the Gaslamp but those are minimal complaints.  It makes great people watching and there always seem to be a lot of middle aged women (cougars) prowling for young men there which my buddies and I often find hilarious.",

Never had a bouncer apologize to me before but that alone tells you that even he thought it was a joke.\n\nWe get in and its packed, practically standing room only. I found 2 empty stools by the atm machine and was surprised that no one snatched them up. Well,that particular spot is so tight, everytime someone walked by they rubbed up against you. I kept checking to see if my wallet was still in my pocket.\n\nBesides the line outside, there was a mini line at the atm machine behind me ! People were singing 80's songs, which I kinda like, but when I'm in a bar, I dont wanna listen to \" I wanna know what love is \" by Foreigner. They did sing \" Sweet Caroline \" and that was cool, the crowd got into it, as did I.\n\nThe crowd was pretty mixed, alot better than the typical PB crowd. Guinness was fairly cheap but I only had 1. Went to the bathroom and I see 2 girls coming out of the mens. They giggled and walked off as I walked in.\n\nOn the way out I see the bouncer telling some guys that if they didnt want to pay $5 then they wont get in, and they can take it up with the owner of the bar. Haha.\n\nI read some of the reviews and all this talk about cougars. I saw an old guy that looked like Earnest Hemingway and a lady that falls in the cougar category but everyone else was young.\n\nI dont think I'll be back if they continue to charge a cover fee.",

Yes there's stupid people and smart people alike. But that's what I love about this bar. There's a managerie, there's no specific crowd, dress code, or mindset.\n\nThis is a simple bar where you come to get fucked up and don't care who sees because the bartenders are usually drunk too. D not order anything special here. Stick to beer and shots. The mixed drinks are best to be left with only 2 ingredients, ie: rum and coke, cranberry vodka, scotch on the rocks.\n\nThis also happens to be the best hookup bar in San Diego. Although a lot of weirdos come here, it's fun to mess with them. This is the best and most funny place to people watch. If you're a people observer when you're drunk, there's a plethora of material here from the old drunks ,to the desparate youngins out to get laid, to Rocko who believes someone is going to discover his singing capabilties in a dive bar in the middle of Mission Hills. I guess give a man his dreams, right?\n\nRock on Lamplighter.",

                  "review": "Last night my girlfriend called, who I hadn't seen in about 9 years and asked if I wanted to join her at the Lamplighter.  Hmmm, I thought, my dad was just admitted into the hospital, my kid is playing video games, my dog has already pooped and my boyfriend sucks at communication.  \"Sure.\" I replied and made plans to meet up.  She wanted to get there around nine, something I couldn't accomplish, being called at 7:30, so we made plans to meet up around 930.\n\nI was late, because I was fighting with my fake eyelashes.  I love to wear them but they like to glue themselves to my cleavage if they accidentally slip from my fingers and fall.  Then the glue leaves these wonderful white eye booger looking things in its wake, which to me is not too sexy.\n\nThe drive from Otay Ranch to W. Washington street took about 25 minutes.  Not too bad.  The parking at 10pm on a Friday night was fairly easy, or maybe I just got lucky.  I looked on the north side of Washington instead of the Lamplighter side and was rewarded immediately by an end slot.\n\nGetting in the door was pretty easy too, if you have your $5 handy and your picture ID.  The doorman was burly, unimpressed and gruff.  I liked him.  He really looked at my ID, then at me, then back at the ID.  I can not help that the DMV decided to use my 10 year old picture on my license renewal and that I am super hot now.  It's way confusing I know!\n\nWhen you first walk through the door you enter right into a swarm of people surrounding the bar.  You can look to the left and to the right and without knowing where the \"pool table near the karaoke stage\" is.  You may feel overwhelmed and want to turn around and head back out.  I had to pee, so I fought through the urge of \"flight\".   I saw the sign of the pee man and figured the pee woman had to be near, so I made my way in through the mass.  I touched people on their backs so they wouldn't stomp into me - this is a necessary tool, so if you don't like to touch strangers or be touched then you probably don't want to go to the Lamplighter on a Friday night.  \n\nI had to pass by a pool table, which was placed in the worst possible location.  At least I remembered that you don't try to push by the guy with the stick.  Surprisingly the bathroom was empty and there was only one stall with a door (at Camel's Breath, they have a shower curtain) and soap and omg - paper towels.  So, all in all the bathroom experience wasn't one to be compared to an outhouse of the worst kind.  I found my friend and stood, leaning against a post and finally looked around.\n\nThe crowd was definitely more guy heavy than girl heavy.  The men ranged in ages too, from young cute preppy types to older men who were there for who knows what reasons.  You could tell the regulars from the irregulars by the crowds reaction to them walking up to the mics.  Most of the singing was decent, which was a relief, although some people insisted on screaming into the mics when they thought it was necessary, which caused a physical ringing to happen in my ear.  \n\nThe girls were heavy too, although not all of them.  I personally, fall into the heavy category so I felt at home.  I don't think any of the heavy ones could compete with my sexiness however, so I felt pretty good about that.  LOL.   What I really liked about all the girls who sang, was the way that they did it.  They were confident, acted sexy, moved their asses a bit and were pretty animated.  If they weren't trying to be all that, then they were just genuinely having a great time, which made them all very likable.  I found myself singing along and grooving in my seat (as some were abandoned and we were able to slip in).  I was not accosted, although with the looks that were passed our way, I think it would have definitely been possible.  \n\nLadies, if you want some attention, then I think the Lamplighter is a great place for getting it.\n\nI wanted to sing, but the Godfather looked really mean.  Actually, the way he was propped behind his stand, his glasses at the end of his nose, he reminded me of the producer guy on Jerry Springer.  He didn't smile, I didn't see him talking and he was checking his tip jar frequently.  Pulling at dollar bills and making marks on his clipboard.  I was told that I would need to tip him to move up the ranks.  So, I opted out of making my way to his stand... there was the inner diva screaming that I was a poophead, but I fought the urge to share my unbelievable talents with that crowd. He should have had one of those credit card swipers at his stand, then he would have gotten some action from me.\n\nAll in all, if you have a DD, don't wear anything that you care about, like to be touched by strangers, want to sing and groove, have eardrums busted and want to flirt with Godfather guy and give away money so you can impress a crowd of the happy drunken sort then Lamplighter on a Friday night is perfect for you.",

And a bachelorette party full of woo girls trying to get guys to buy them drinks. And then spilling those drinks on me. Where am I, PB Bar & Grill?",

I love to sing and can sometimes be found there busting some old standards.\n\nFrom 96-99, I was an almost nightly fixture, one of the many \"Norms\" that hung out there, but when I moved away to Texas for five years, I kind of outgrew it.  Despite my Lamp love, I think that's a good thing.  One's liver can only take so much.\n\nBut, I love the Lamplighter still.  The drinks are strong, the characters are MANY and the books, while falling apart, have one of, if not the best selection in town.\n\nNow, don't go on the weekend unless you want to put up with a bunch of young drunk punkasses who think it's their own personal discovery (you know, how you were in 1996 *cough*) and pay a cover.  Hence the missing star.  No offense to any young drunk punkasses that may be reading this.\n\nI like Mondays and Tuesdays, but whatever blows your dress up.",

No one wants to make an assumption based on gender. They don't ask the males in scubs if they are nurses..... Anyway, that's a picky point, and the fault of the clientele, not the establishment.\n\nGood Juke box selections.\n\nArt, the long time bartender, starts at 0600. He can be a little gruff around the edges, but he pours a mean drink. If you ask him, he'll get out the menu for the Huddle and will take breakfast orders and they deliver barside. That's a great bonus.\n\nBecause I am old, I do not care for The Lamplighter at night- karaoke? Tell those people they are not American Idol. Never will be (well....look at Shajin, or whatever his name is, I saw him at the Lamplighter).\n\nI have been there once for Sunday football games- great.",

I'd go when he's not there to be on the safe side.\n\nThere's always strange things happening around and behind the bar -- I'm talking to you, crazy-eyed-bartender-who-appears-much-more-intoxicated-than-the-patrons.

Honestly if Scolari's office was still how it used to be in North Park, nobody would be coming here if it wasn't for the Karaoke.\n\nOh yeah and the fact that you have to \"tip\" the DJ to karaoke sooner is absurd. The more $ you tip him, the further up the line on the list you go. If you dont tip him at all expect 1-2 hours for your name to be called even if you are the 4th person on the sign up sheet. Oh and the fact that they allow the same songs to be sung over and over should be banned- nobody wants to hear 5 no doubt songs in one night.",

My trip to SD this weekend was marked with one of the funnest Lighter nights EVA.  \n\nThe crowd is fun, the drinks are strong, and the bartenders are quick.  Yeah yeah, you have to pay the K-Jay to get moved up the list and actually sing.  (It's 5 bucks, get over yourself.)  Yeah yeah, it's crowded and you will prob get drinks spilled on you.  Yeah yeah, people are really annoying when someone sings Summer Lovin' or Brown Eyed Girl for the 3rd time that night. But lighten up and have fun, because when else will you get to see your office mates singing You Give Love a Bad Name?    \n\nThe crowd gets really into it if you put on a good show.  (did anyone catch my rendition of Total Eclipse of the Heart this past Friday?  Capped with writing around on stage at the finale?  LOL)   And it also helps if you have a few people to reprazent, hoot and holler, and in general to provide moral support.  The drinks themselves are enough to give you plenty of liquid courage (thanks Tom and Russ!  YIKES!)  \n\nLoosen up, enjoy the crowd - very diverse and I always find some fun people to talk to, and have fun wit' it, (if you're that serious of a karaoke holic, go to one of the Tio Leo's and sing your little heart out.)    Oh be warned of the bathroom, there's only 1 and it can get messy/crowded/long wait.",

My friends and I like to describe the Lamplighter as a wormhole. You go in, you come out, and you're not quite sure what happened while you were there - but you're pretty sure there was tequila involved.\n\nEclectic crowd. Divey atmosphere. Cash only for drinks - but there's an ATM in house. Get there early if you want to sing b/c the place gets packed. And like a lot of KJ's, they get political towards the end of the night so if you really want to sing, fork over the dough. And beware of the ornery bartenders. They will bite.",

You can always tell a good dive bar by their cash register and I'm pretty sure the lamp lighter probably has the oldest register known to man (or woman for that matter). Decent selection of beer - pool table - clean bathrooms for a dive bar - nice people - good times.\n\nI didn't have to pay a cover but I went pretty early on a Wednesday night so I don't know what its like on the weekends.",

Plus  high-stakes Deer Hunter-like late night Karoake, you know the scene.  Image all those guys waiting around for their song then belting it out like the gun was in their ear.\n\nLast note, thanks to the bartender and bouncers who took mercy on my drunk ass and didn't pound me to a pulp when you caught me walking around the bar with your handle of Tequila.  Lessons learned:  (you) shouldn't be leaving that thing laying around and (me) that married ex-girlfriends are big trouble.  \n\nDouble props for finding my wife's purse, with money still inside and being open early the next morning for cab of shame pick up.",

Although, it's still fun t to watch others throw caution to the wind.  It is a decent dive bar when you consider everything other than the karaoke.  But it's often packed to the max leaving little wiggle room.  And the cover charge on the weekends has been a strong deterrent as of late.\n\nNot my first choice when I'm out and about in search of stirring up trouble. However, we return once in a blue moon, say, when family or friends from out of town visit and are looking for a decent, middle of the road bar: not overly pretentious and pricey as you'd find in the Gaslamp, and not overly hipstery as a lot of places uptown can be.",

Also there is a $5 cover.\n\nOnce you are in, there is just entertainment everywhere!  The karaoke is usually very good, but don't let that scare you away, get up and sing!  \n\nI have fun here, but there's not much I can say about a karaoke bar since it really depends on the night you go. Have fun while you are here though and don't be the lame duck in the corner criticizing, if  you are that good show your stuff buddy!",

It fashions itself as a dive bar even though everyone that goes there tries really, really hard to be a hipster. So...that means it's not a dive bar. In any case, if you like karaoke this is the place to be. On a weekday, or without a giant crowd this place is tremendous though. There just isn't a ton of space to manuever around, but it's tough not to really like the Lamplighter a lot.",

Get here nice and early and get a seat next to the other barflies and stay all day.   There are no windows so you'll never know what time it is.

(I like lemon in my vodka) Weird.\nThere is a slight smell near the back of the bar, but it doesn't permeate the entire bar and there are a few random really creepy people there...you just have to know how to ignore them.\n\nOtherwise, its generally a good time.

There were 5 people in this place when 6 of us walked in to drink, play pool and sing karaoke. Took quite a while for the bar tender to stop talking to the couple at the other end of the bar and serve us. We just doubled their business, you would think they would be happy! Karaoke was supposed to start at 9, but it hadn't started when we left at 9:35. We walked out when the KJ, who obviously didn't want to be there, gave my husband some attitude. Too bad for them because my husband and I  love to sing and our friends would have stayed to watch. We all would have bought more drinks, but I guess they don't need or want our business. I suggest they call \"Bar Rescue\" to help make it into the cool place it could be.",

As luck would have it, I happened to pick the BEST karaoke bar I've ever been to! Really great system, good balancing in the mics, strong monitor, and fun stage set-up. And if you don't like karaoke, there's a pool table and plenty of seating in the back. As an added bonus, the crowd is super friendly and Pete, my bartender, was great. If I lived down in SD, this would be my regular bar. Definitely check it out if you're in the area!",

I showed up with my crew and put my name down to sing some Adina Howard Freak Like Me. Any 90s lover would have lost it as soon as that first line hit.\n\nI counted 8 people ahead of me on the list.  2 hours later I was still waiting. Literally the same three people went up over and over to sing songs that were worse and worse. The two courtesy claps after each showed how involved the crowd was.\n\nI get it, you have to tip the kj. But really lamplighter, you're not even trying to appeal to guests. Drinks are ok, servers couldn't care less about being there. Chorus kareoke cafe it is",

Cheap drinks, poorly lit, graffiti scrawled bathrooms, all complete with obnoxiously loud, poorly sung music.  All the ingredients would hopefully create a symphony but the Lamplighter falls flat.  The last several times that I've visited, it's been overly crowded and my gin and tonic tasted more like tonic.  To add, you have to put a pretty generous tip in the tip jar to even think about singing karaoke (think Fidel pre-retirement).  To the Lamplight's credit, the bouncer is hilariously dry with his humor.\n\nC'mon though, a $5 cover for a dive bar?  Really, a cover for a dive bar?  That  practically contradicts the dive bar mentality.",

I went there with little expectations and was down right shocked at how wasted I got and the ferocious amount of fun I had. I highly recommend if you do brave the Lamp not to be the DD. The place is downright frightening and kind of depressing if you can't indulge in the $4 drinks stiffer than your d*ck and the place has a unique aroma of beer, puke, shame, and sweat.  This place, the location, and crowd are a welcome change from the usual douche-baggery and over priced drinks you find at most places in town. Go early, the place gets pretty packed on the weekends and make sure you know how old you are cuz the bouncer (in his maroon sweatshirt) loves to ask.\n\nIf my excellent review hasn't convinced you to go to the Lamplighter my Dad partied there in the 70s.

The oompa loompa working the front door is a ball buster but as long as you ignore him and those red wrestling boots he's wearing it's all good.  This place is what it is and doesn't give a fuck.  It feels like 1970 in here and you can just picture where the cigarette dispenser used to be full of Marlboro's and Pall Mall's.  Not a good date spot but if you're looking to get shitty and maybe get lucky come on in.  \n\nIt's dark and dingy in here and I'd feel pretty bad about myself if I was drinking here mid day during a work week.  3 consecutive nights of Lamplighter, an 8ball and chain smoking will definitely put you on suicide watch.  Thursday-Saturday is full of alcoholics.  This is the type of place to get sloshed and no one is going to look down on you, half of the bar is driving home drunk anyways.  It's not PB but there are plenty of retards here.  Most of the singers are terrible and after 12am you see some real pieces of work on stage.  Tino may be small in stature but he can sing like a motherfucker.  \n\nLive long and prosperous Lamplighter.",

As for the drinks, I wasn't drinking so I can't tell you how they were. SORRY... However everyone else seemed to enjoy them! We found a booth in the back but as we sat there for a minute we realized why it was open. it smelled just like hot cat ass....

Ross came to the rescue and he made it happen because the poor girl didn't want anything more than sing on stage with brave and not-even-tipsy-enough-to-make-an-ass-of-myself me.\n\nApparently the crowd there had no idea who Jefferson Airplane was maybe except the 60-year-old guy sitting in the back. Either that or we just had ourselves a tough crowd, or maybe I just can't admit that I have horrendous pipes.\n\nThe minus two stars are dedicated to the karaoke DJ that looked like Vincent Schiavelli on \"Ghost\". I think you must pay extra. I'm all about tipping, but with that kind of treatment I want to keep my moneys far far away from you.\n\nI came back for more vodka tonics and a conversation about weddings with the bartender.

Happily, I have found there are some real talented folks who sing here, likely with hopes of showing up the one night Timbaland is in town.\n\nOverall, it is tough to get drinks, overcrowded like a college party in a teen comedy, and almost impossible to talk. The conversations I manage to strike up whenever I show up tend to be genuine, which is a perk.\n\nThis place sucks sober. Simply sucks. There are just too many bodies and the most nonsensical pool table of all time.\n\nAll said and done, this place is fun in the middle of the week.

The birthday girl was big into Karaoke, and so am I, so I was amped for this place.\n\nThe bar was a bit crowded, but my group was able to get a booth in the back corner. After about two beers and some shots we all strolled on up to the Karaoke master and signed up.\n\nWhat I loved is that they had fairly new songs that had been released in like 2008. I myself am partial to girl rock songs, so I was able to sing my heart out to Paramore and No Doubt.\n\nI read a review where someone said that the karaoke guy only let you sing unless you paid. This is not entirely true. There was another birthday group and the girl kept paying the guy and he would let them cut the line, but when I approached him about it and asked him, he allowed my group to keep the order. No problem, no stress. After a while my group just kept going one after the other, and we developed a fairly good rotation with the people I could only assume was local.\n\nThe reason I'm giving this place 4 stars was because there was a $5 cover and the bar was cash only. Bars that charge cover kind of annoy me, but what are you gonna do? I only had enough for the cab fare to the bar and back home, so I had to take money out of the ATM, after cover. The drinks are VERY reasonably priced (including some VERY GENEROUS Patron shots), but the ATM charged $3.50. Kind of lame, but I would DEFINITELY go back again and recommend this place.\n\nI agree with Anna T.'s comment about having fun while your there. Definitely don't be afraid to sing along with the karaoke, even the people who hold the microphone too close to their face and scream into it. There's also pool tables and I never had a problem getting a drink even when it was packed.\n\nHave fun!",

So if you are rolling to the Lamp, make sure to hit your bank before.\n\nUsually there are singers that have good pipes and can bang out some good performances, but like all karaoke joints, expect the drunk and utterly bad singers as well.\n\nMy Boy Russ is a bartender there and I can always count on a shot of Yukon Jack as soon as he sees me.\n\nThe doorman is a cool dude, once you get to know him.

I've been here only a few times but each time for either my or a friends birthday.  Saturday was for my birthday.  I'm not sure what it is about this place that generates a crowd, but wow does it!  Drinks are strong, ambience is casual, music is loud and people singing at octives louder than is reasonable. Love this place.",

                  "review": "I haven't been this angry in a long time....\n\nRemember that character, The Soup Nazi, from Seinfeld? Well, the spirit of that fiery gent resides at Lamplighter...in the form of a karaoke slinger. The way he runs his operation is shady and embarrassing.\n\nI've been here numerous times over the years, but I think I've finally had enough.\n\nThe bar itself is pretty cool. It's right in the 'hood and I generally enjoy people who hang there. Russ, who bartends and works the door from time-to-time, is the man and the only reason I'm giving this place two stars.\n\nBasically, the only way you're gonna be allowed to sing a drunken version of Bon Jovi's \"Livin' on a Prayer,\" is if you throw the old dude running the ship a $20. Even then, you're not guaranteed to get up there. It's so lame. Me and my buddies got to the bar at 8:30 p.m. There were 6 of us and we all signed up to sing within about 10 minutes of each other. I was the first to sign up in the group, and admittedly, he let me belt out Rudolph The Red Nosed Reindeer (love singing Christmas carols) right away. Unfortunately, I was the only member of our group that would get the chance to shine for the rest of the night. We were there until 1:00 a.m...no dice. However, I noticed that the same group of people were going up there 3, 4, 5 times each. This same dude with a horrid-looking Tommy Bahama button up shirt sang 5 times throughout the evening....but my buddy Javier was still on the sidelines. I also noticed that people would JUST walk into the place, and be on stage in about 5 minutes. From that moment, I started noticing the shady activity going on behind the console.\n\nPersonally, I would never even pay $1 to sing karaoke. It's just one of those fun little side-activities to partake in...but the karaoke version of the Soup Nazi was wheelin' and dealing his way to a pretty nice payday. I saw one guy throw him a large bill...and guess what happened? Him and his group of drunks magically got bumped to the top of the list. How annoying is that?\n\nSo, after taking note of the suspicious activity, I confronted the guy and asked, \"so, the only way to actually get up here and sing is to give you money, huh?\" He got all flustered and replied with, \"Uh...I don't know dude...when these kids start throwing money at me, I just lose track of who's next in line.\" Das some bullshit! An actual quote, BTW. Why the fuck should anyone have to pay this old man to get on stage? Especially with the $5 cover charge upon entry. Not cool.\n\nBecause my buddy really wanted to sing Fiddy's \"In Da Club,\" his lady friend gave the karaoke dictator $10 to get him on stage. Apparently, that wasn't good enough, as his name still wasn't called. After 4 hours of trying, we gave up. I asked Mr. Karaoke man for her $10 back, but he refused. What a jerk.\n\nThe funny thing is, this happens all the time. It's nothing new. But, it's totally whack. I can't believe a bar that prides itself on nightly karaoke would allow this to happen. What a turnoff.\n\nLamplighter, you are dead to me.",

Pete was the name of the bartender who served us. He was friendly and efficient, and we never went more than 15 seconds or so without having our drinks replenished. Overall it was just a fun night.

I sang my best rendition of \"Stand By Your Man\" I've ever sang before. It was a proud moment. I guess that's the appeal of the Lamplighter. There's no judgment. It's a dive but a proud dive.

Although I was ordering long beaches and tokyo teas, so maybe that had something to do with it..? Anyway, karaoke was fun, although I didn't do it myself as my friends were under strict instructions not to let me, but I did dance for hours. Great crowd as well, met a couple really cool people. Don't know if it's always like this, but definitely a good vibe.\nMinus a star for the bar being understaffed. Only one bartender was there when we got there, basically running the place, answering phones, checking IDs. It was also kind of useless as he was so busy, he only checked some people's IDs as they walked in, I mean, what's the point? Another bartender showed up later, but it still took forever to get drinks. A couple in our group were double-fistin' cause of it.\nOverall, don't expect anything more than a dive bar, but it's a good one.",

This place was the first place I ever went to for Karaoke last year in December and i've gone back plenty of times since. The people are cool most of the time never had any or even seen any drama go down there so thats good. I would give this place 5 stars but sometimes the Bartenders are dicks and they never have cream so i can get a white russian also they need to get cordless mics. Other than that the music selection, the people, and the stage are all good. If you see me there don't be shy to say whats up i'll probably be singing some Hall & Oates or The Smiths with my best friend haha.",

You have to pay the karaoke DJ in order to sing, which isn't my favorite part of the situation, but everytime I have gone there have been a ton of people so if you didn't pay you probably would run out of time before it got to your turn on the list.",

Four of us hung out at the Lamplighter last Sat night and got a table right in front.  Dude with the Mac (disguised as The Most Interesting Man In The World) running the karaoke gig was a First Class wiener.  We were there for THREE HOURS and did not get our names called even ONE of the 5 times we had written them down. We even threw about 10 bucks worth of tips in Douchus Maximus' jar.  THREE HOURS.  I totally checked his list out.  He crossed off names in a random way--didn't follow any order.  Oh wait.  I take that back.  He DID follow an order: in order of descending cash payments to him under the table.  So here's the skinny...If you want to sing Radar Love with your best gal at the Lamplighter next Saturday, sign your names up on the list and with great flair, remove a Jackson from your wallet, take a Sharpie and write \"You'd better play my song.  And fast, Mr. Ponzi\", hold both ends of the bill in your hands and snap it loudly in his face by pulling both ends taught , twice in rapid succession, and hand it to him with bravado.\n\nOr just go to another karaoke place where the operator is not a D-bag.",

Thinking that our arriving late would probably place us a little further down on the list for singing but then very surprised that there appeared to be no sign of anything about to happen other than some crazy carrying on in the back of the bar.  \nMy wife and I took a seat in a booth and waited for someone to come and take our drink orders but no one ever did.\nWhen the karaoke DJ finally arrived around 9:45, I signed up as the first person to sing and signed up to do my usual Johnny Cash number of \"Folsom Prison Blues\", expecting that even if we were ignored by the staff in our expectation of receiving a drink, we would none-the-less receive the first bid to be onstage since no one else in the place paid any attention to the female karaoke DJ when she arrived.  It appeard as if nothing was as exciting to them as their junior high antics taking place around the farthest part of the bar.  (Did anyone check IDs?)  \nThen we were shocked when someone who had not signed up to sing got up on the stage singing \"Balls\" wherein all the patrons were guffawing like those same junior high school kids who had just been informed that one of their class had dropped his jockstrap on the way to gym class.\nI was not embarrassed by the song but I was embarrassed by this crowd's lack of\nmaturity and their endorsement of such drivel.\nI am a professional singer and could have electrified them with my singing but alas , my wife and I walked out without having any drinks served to us and without any opportunity to entertain.  \nAfter living and traveling all over the US, this is not what we expected to find in a place like San Diego.",

Morse '79 white guy in a northface winter coat with the pinoy asian fever. \"Mabuhay tigers!\" Guy who just broke up with his girl 2hrs earlier manhandling a friendly woman. Love in this club being found by two lovebirds to the backdrop of a projection screen with the line \"Out of nothing at all\" about 50 times over. The Karaoke DJ guy looks like he hates his life. I would too if I had to hear drunk white people singing either \"Ice Ice Baby\" or \"Baby Got Back\" 7 nights a week. I think he liked us Filipinos who came through and added some much needed variety to the song selections rather than the usual Eminem - \"Without Me's\" There's a good book of song selection. Has a lot of new stuff. But unfortunately, no Sasha Fierce...yet. The stage is kinda ghetto with the cable public access bed sheet pinned to the wall. When your up there the mics feel like they don't work. But we're all off key anyways, so who cares. Place is cash only and the ATM charges you $3.50! WTF?!

                  "review": "I love the Lamplighter but I hate to say it, it is the most over rated Karaoke spot in San Diego.\n\nMe and hubby are Karaoke bar hoppers 4 sure! We have been to almost all the Karaoke bars here in San Diego. The Lamplighter is in my top 5 but it is # 5 not #1\n\nThe Pros's\n(1) There are some really cool, down to earth, nice people at the Lamplighter and the drinks are always good.\n(2) If you are lucky, the bouncer (a tough but fair, ex body builder) may show you his awesome portfolio of body building achievements (if you are very lucky) which is quite impressive, granted you are a pleasant person, somewhat sober, with genuine interest. Warning: If you come in drunk and rude this is not the guy to mess with!\n(3) The singers are pretty good....but remember it is still Karaoke!\n(4)They do have a stage for added stardom power\n(5) Parking is free and with a little work not to hard to find\n(6) The bartenders and staff are awesome!\n\nWarning!!!!!!!!\nGet there early!!!! There is a huge crowd,  walking to the stage when your name is call is a struggle, if you do not find a table up front!\n\nNow the Cons\n(1) My biggest con is tipping a Karaoke DJ just to get a song in is total B.S. plain and simple. It is very unethical and unfair to people who have not sung yet that are already on the list. Sorry but shame on you Lamplighter Karaoke  DJ!!!!!!  I do not tip the bartender until I get my drink, why should this be any diffident or even necessary? I would rate this place a 4 if it was not for this new underhanded policy. I rather be charged a flat rate per song (Japanese Style) and told up front how much to pay and when I can go up and sing. I always tip my DJ but I will not be coerced into paying!\n(2) A cover charge for Karaoke! Yes it is only $5, but still, this is Karaoke people!\n(3) The only reason The Lamplighter is such a famous dive bar is because several very dated websites come up on Goggle when you type in the key words \"San Diego Karaoke Bars\". Unfortunately, the websites that call this place \"Best Karaoke bar\", still have Karaoke bars on there list of \"Best Karaoke bars\", that have been closed for years...ahhhhh the irony! The Lamplighter is not the best Karaoke bar but it is on the list of only a handful of bars that do full time Karaoke and Sat. night Karaoke.\n\nSummery\nKeep everything the same, I can even live with the cover, except fire the Karaoke DJ, hire the guy at Winston's (he has \"rules\" he posts on the front table that I wish every Karaoke bar had) and he is a great entertainer!  \n\nWinston's in PB (Sun only) is on the top of my chart as well as JP's on Clairmon, and Whiskey Girl's new Karaoke corner in the basement of there large club in Gaslamp.",

Large white boys with no skills are dancing like they just finished watching Footloose...and are pumped up! Sweating, shaking their heads and singing along to San Diego's finest and terriblest (just made that word up)...singers.\nEveryone is drunk...playing pool...standing/sitting/dancing...Fist pumping...and having a blast.\nYou can't walk into this bar and not have fun. It's impossible...\nThe bartenders aren't very nice and are usually drunk, but it just makes it even more interesting...It's located next to Santana's Mexican Food--must follow late night drinking--and if there is a cover it's cheap.\nI love this place...lost a star cause the bathroom smells like barf and almost made me barf.\nCheck it out...take a cab or walk...to really experience it the way you're suppose to without landing yourself in jail.",

The book is like 6 inches thick!!\n\nMini stage for you singers out there , with a jumbo screen with the lyrics as well as a smaller TV overhead. Lights flashing in your face, and speakers blaring...you almost have to do the Mariah Carey thing and plug your ear so you can hear yourself sing.\n\nIt was pretty crowded when I went there Friday night, so don't expect to find sitting room if you come late. Also, tipping the MC is beneficial to getting your song up if there is a lot of people on the list. If you go earlier in the week, you can get up at least twice no problem.",

Tom was an awesome bartender (I think he worked there for about 10+ years!) and no longer works there :(  \n\nWe STOPPED going because the RUDE karaoke dude would not call you up to sing unless you tipped AT LEAST $5!!  If you put a tip in the tip jar he would wait till you turned around, grab the bill to see what it was, and if not sufficient, no singing your heart out to \"I will survive\" or \"Total eclipse of the heart\"!!!  We all said that we were gonna boycott Lamplighter, and told all of our friends to do the same!\n\nA year or two ago, a  friend and I had dinner a few doors down, and walked by Lamplighter, and were going to go in for a drink or two, and there was a cover charge!  I started laughing and said to the doorman \"dude, it's a dive bar\".  We went somewhere else.  Obviously, people took a stand because there is currently no cover.\n\nWe recently went back for karaoke, and it's even worse!!!  Not going again unless I hear that things have changed - they should stop being dishonest and just put a sign up that say's \"Minimum $5 a song\".\n\nNow, I've thrown back a few, at many a karaoke dive bars all over the US (I travel a lot), and I have NEVER seen a place where tipping was mandatory to sing.\n\nMaybe someone could pass this on to both of the (again) RUDE karaoke dudes -  you're grown men - stop being haters to drunk people trying to have a good time!!\n\nHOW CAN THE OWNER NOT KNOW THAT THIS IS GOING ON?\n\nI'm giving two stars for:  a) strong drinks  b)  there were some hot guys there that night",

If you are looking for a good time to spend with your friends, I highly recommend heading over to enjoy a few strong drinks and singing your heart out. They have been making amazing renovations including a recent new karaoke stage and DJ booth with more seating and tables. They also have a newly updated karaoke song list with all recent popular songs! I've gone Monday's and Tuesdays to karaoke to avoid long waits. Bottom line...best staff, best drinks, and best crowd.",

It was very very dark inside, and it was filled with middle aged bikers, as in motorcycle drivers with leathers vests and all.  It was guys and gals, and the beers we ordered were served in clear plastic cups.  It was pretty laid back at that time but I definitely wouldn't go in there ever again because it was definitely a bit of a dive.",

Sounded good to us so we went.  Not a bad decision but not a great one either.\n\nFirst off there was a five dollar cover charge.  I should tell you that I don't like cover charges.  I am getting charged to come into the bar to spend money in the bar, a cover charge just seems ridiculous to me.  Anyways my boy says I got this.  It's great having friends that really know you.\n\nWhen we get inside it was crazy.  Standing room only and everyone having a good time.  The drinks were strong and a good (not great) price so I can't knock it for that.  The problem I had was it was too crowded.  Normally I am all for a packed house but this place bordered on dangerous.  If a fire broke out pretty much half of the patrons would be done.  You simply can't reach the exits without bumpin into forty people it was crazy.  \n\nLastly as a side note this girl got mad at me because I wouldn't buy her a drink.  I was at the bar waiting for my friends to come back when this girl tells the bartender to get her a beer and I was paying for it.  I said excuse me I don't even know you.  She the introduced herself as Sherri and her lady parts hurt so it would be nice if I would buy her a drink.  I said I don't think so.  She told me please I only have a dollar and a beer cost three.  Well people if you don't have no money keep your broke ass home.   I told her I wasn't going to buy her a drink, at this time the bartender said I need three dollars.  She opened her wallet and must have had at least two hundred dollars in there.  I said guess you are really broke.  She then got mad and started cursing me.  I said whatever and order me another drink and pulled out a hundred to pay for it just to piss her off more.  I just don't get some people.\n\nOverall the Lamplighter is cool but it is a place to hit every once in a while not to make a main stay in my rotation of bars I visit.",

This is a great place, cheap drinks, friendly people and singing.  The place is a simple set up, your usual pool tables, darts and what not.  But the most important thing IS the karaoke.  This makes the atmosphere.  You get great choices in songs, and you get your occasional \"BAD-ASS\" singer, but most of all you get people like me who think they can sing.  Just put a little courage juice inside you and go up and do your thing.  Most people are too far gone to even notice that you are singing off key anyways, and it's a different place you can sing to aside from your shower and your car.  Common, where else can you sing Small Town Girl by Journey and everyone starts dancing and singing along with you?  This is your place to be a Rockstar for a night.",

However, It does get crowded, and when it does, as a male, you will get ignored by the male bartenders. Your only saving grace is the scantly clothed waitress walking around. She will keep the beers coming if you tip her well and give her a wink. They do have karaoke, and the locals get crazy when the bartender gets on stage and sings an 80's power anthem or country song. Also, they only except cash. Why??? My only guess is because they want to please the people with tight rolled jeans and big bangs or the country folks who only carry cash in their boots!",

Last time I was there I was also charged $2 for a coke (after I had already bought several drinks)...if that's the kind of place the Lamplighter is going to turn into, I won't be going anymore.\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool\n7/10/2010Previous review\nI still love the Lamplighter but I've seen some of the recent, and not so recent reviews regarding required tipping if you want to sing karaoke.  To my knowledge, the only DJ at the Lamplighter who does this is the old guy with the beard, and to my knowledge he only works on Friday and/or Saturday nights.\nEvery other night I have been to the Lamplighter it has been one of the three other DJ's...and they do not require you to tip them.  However if the list is long, its 1 AM, and you've already sang three times...yeah you might have to tip.  But generally with the DJ's during the week...if you get there early and sign up early, most likely you'll get to sing at least twice...depending on how busy it gets.\nRead more\n7/28/2007Previous review\nSince I am usually working Friday nights and all day Saturday, I usually hit this place up during the week to have a few drinks and sing some karaoke...blow off some steam.\nFrom what I hear it can get really crowded on the weekends and that there is also a cover charge after a certain point on Friday & Saturday nights...so that's probably why I avoid it then.\nBut when I have been during the week it has been awesome.  Cheap drinks, not the cheapest drinks in San Diego, but I would still consider them inexpensive compared to other places.  The song selection for the karaoke is OUTSTANDING.  Sometimes the singers are, and sometime they aren't haha.  I have had my good moments and my bad moments here, but its all in good fun.",

If you don't want to hear people singing than go to the million other bars in San Diego that don't host karaoke and let the people who like to sing some songs (good or bad) have fun.\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool",

You Poker Face (lol) or you can sing a horrible rendition of the song Poker Face on karaoke night at The Lamplighter like some guy did last night.  \n\nIt seems like every time I go to the Lamplighter it happens to be a kareoke night.  I'm not too into karaoke, but I am into people making fools of them selves. The Lamplighter is your typical dive bar. It's not too big so it gets pretty packed. The drinks are not the stiffest but they aren't weak either. The beer selection is decent but nothing to brag about. But that's ok cause the drinks are nice and cheap. You could probably find parking pretty close by. I got there around 10 at night on a Saturday and found some right away. The Lamplighter is a low key spot filled mostly with people who aren't dressed to impress but that's what a dive bar should be filled with.  It's cash only which sucks because I couldn't find the ATM in there (I didn't look to hard tho.) It's a bit grimey looking inside, but again, that's what a dive should be like.  I don't always have fun here and i'm not sure if it's the choice of music the people sing or the crowd in general but the Lamplighter is always a nice little change of pace.",

Its great to come here if you've already drank a substantial amount and just wanna watch or sing karaoke. I only really come here to support my friends. It seems really hard to get a drink here. Maybe its because im not an attractive female. Ive had to stand at the bar and wait a few minutes until the bartender finishes his conversation with the other bartender ( with both of them making eye contact with me). Call me crazy but I think that's rude. Im the only one at the bar requesting a drink at that time, and you see that I want one, but you still make me wait. and this waiting happened 3 times in 1 night. Other than that its a dimly lit dive bar where the good karaoke singers go.",

The bartenders, Pete, Russ, Tommy and Rick know everyone's name and drink.  People sit and hang out, it gets busy but there is still room to walk around and conversate with your bartender.  The crowd on Thursday to Saturday nights is a little crazier, they are the people on the way or leaving downtown, the PB kids that want to get out of PB one night and the regulars that are there during the other weeknights!  All in all it makes for a great place top pick up people, not that I would know................\n\nThe drinks and bar staff are wonderful.  What can I say, cheap strong drinks served by a bunch of native San Diegans who know everyone that you need to know in San Diego?  And if it's a weekend night, my friend Katie is serving us the cocktails!!!  I've never had a bad drink here, and I love everyone that works there.................\n\nAnd of course the karaoke is fun.  You have the David Bowie lookalikes, the guy that brings in his own discs to sing to, the girls that always sing \"When I touch myself\" and \"Like a Virgin\" and then those that sing in the shower and then on the night that you are there get the strength to go up via liquid courage from the bar staff...................",

                  "review": "The Lamplighter strives to be both a dive bar and a karaoke venue and sadly, it succeeds at neither.  Yes, they do offer karaoke every night, which might seem like a draw, however, unless you arrive as soon as they open to get your name on the list or you are willing to bribe the KJ, you probably won't get a chance to sing. If you are \"lucky\" enough to to get the opportunity, you will probably not be heard over the din of the bar, which in some cases is a good thing, but as far as karaoke goes, not much fun.  In addition the KJ seems absolutely miserable to be there, probably because the bar does have a certain, um, distinctive aroma, and the karaoke is done assembly line style with little enthusiasm.\nOn the other side is the \"dive bar\" which is crowded and noisy, and you will be shoved trying to get to and from the bar.  It has all of the dive-y skeeviness of a good dive bar, with none of the charm.  I would caution anyone against ordering a drink that comes in a glass, and if you do, be sure to get a straw.  While most of the dive bars in San Diego offer some sort of incentive for their patrons (think the excellent craft beer selections of The Waterfront, High Dive, and Aero Club, or the live entertainment options of some other venues), The Lamplighter just has the abysmal karaoke.\nNot the worst place in San Diego, but certainly not a destination spot, the Lamplighter is fine if you don't don't go expecting spectacular.",

Are you kidding me!?!? In a bar?? Where there are LOTS of women?? And it wasn't winning any health department awards for cleanliness!!

It's considered a dive bar and has the black seats and dim lighting typical of such places, but the place is actually very clean and comfortable. Some of my friends played pool, others were watching the winter Olympics, but most of us got down to the tunes on the Karaoke stage. The scene is pretty laid-back, unpretentious, and everybody is there to have a good time. Any nice bar with karaoke and great people automatically earns the minimum four stars in my book.",

I was sold.\n\nWhen I first walked in it was loud in there and I wasnt sure I was up for it.  We ended up having a blast.  By the end of the night we were tipsy singing along with the crowd and talking to locals.  One of the funnest nights Ive had in a long time.\n\nGreat drinks - great prices - great crowd - great service.",

The drinks are really reasonable and the bartenders pours give you a lot of bang for your buck. This place has a great vibe as everyone is there to have a good time and blow off some steam from their work week. The crowd ranges from 21 to even 50, but Id say the majority of the crowd is in the 25-35 range. Look out for cougars tho, they are definitely on the prowl.  The only reason I dock this place one star is the douche bag karaoke dj on the weekends. He only plays your songs based on how much you tip him. I have seen tools give him a $20 and get to go up three times when someone who gives him a $5 not even get their song played. If they got rid of this prick, this joint would be perfect.",

It is not a first come first serve system.  It's a whatever the KJ feels like doing kind of system.  We saw the same people go up over and over again well after we had signed up.  My sister gave the guy 20 bucks and suddenly our names were called.  Interesting...\n\nAnyway, I think it's a fun place overall, but they do need a little ethics reform.",

We would come out for karaoke about once a month, always in a big group and would have a blast and bring lots of business! Lately, I've noticed that it doesn't matter how early you get there and sign up to sing, the karaoke host now only favors those who leave him big tips in his jar. He clearly skips around on the list of singers, some times he will go back to a singer but the last time we were there he skipped our entire group (as if on purpose). It was never said that tips were required and as a group, we'd typically leave him $20 or more as a courtesy. If you're going to be charged to sing karaoke then they should let you know that. It's not fun to sit around waiting for your turn to sing and realize that you've been wasting your time.",

The DJ (I won't call her a KJ because she doesn't know what Karaoke means) told me I was about 20 songs down and she was not sure if we were going to be able to sing.  We put in our song at about 10:PM and it was now almost 1AM so needless to say we were frustrated.  I asked her why she was allowing people (some couldn't stand) to sing multiple times when we had not sung at all.  She said it was because they were \"here first\".  I watched a few more people that came after us sing after we had this conversation as well.  I told her this was no way to treat your guests, that I had been to many Karaoke places and I have never been treated this way.  I sang my song, finally at about 1:15 AM after she let a few more singers go.  My wife stood up after me, told the audience we came all the way from LA to sing but that we were not going to sing.  She gave the mic to the KJ and told her she can go let her friends sing.  I yelled \"KJ SUCKS, SHE'S NOT FAIR\".  Everyone froze and we walked out.  Don't waste your time or money unless you want to see a bunch of drunk people progressively get worse and you only want to sing your one song.  This is not my definition of Karaoke.  If you see the little black haired girl there, ask her why she can't be fair with all their guests.  Very insulting and rude for people who want to sing and want fairness.  No stars if you don't take turns, sorry.",

I get this place is a dive bar, but pretty sure the owners like to make money. If so, they need to check out how their Friday night DJ treats people. There was a group of people I've seen before (with several great singers that get the joint rocking). We kept waiting for them to go up and sing, but sadly never happened.  Then near closing they gave up and left. On their way out the door, the DJ took the opportunity to shout into the microphone \"to the people leaving f*ck you\".  This group bought drinks all night and appeared to drop plenty of cash.  Guessing this was their last time at the Lamplighter, I know for sure it was mine. Plenty of other places to go!!!!!",

From some of the yelp reviews I was scared to go to the lamplighter but I figured if it was gonna be that terrible, we could make it a good time and laugh about it later. We show up to the elusive lamplighter  and lo and behold it was pretty much what I expected: seedy little dive bar, friendly local crowd, and stiff drinks. My first impression of the place was some girl singing \"Party in the U.S.A\" by Miley Cyrus. I sang along in the crowd while waiting for my friends and some random gay men turned around and started cheering me on. Not bad.  Everyone in my party who wanted to sing got a chance to (after waiting a bit) and yes, if you're not a professional chanteuse you may get somewhat nervous going after some of the more talented regulars. Stiff drinks come in handy here. There is nothing really classy about the lamplighter, but in the end I was just glad I could sing destiny's child and let my hair down for a night.",

It is a shame that the father let his business get overrun by his children.  \n1.  Last time I was there the niece which was the karayoke jockey said to my face money talks bull$hit walks.   I signed up early for my song even.    She wanted 20$ for a song.   Get outa here.\n2.  If they have someone filling in as a karayoke jockey, they should be non- discriminatory.  I base my tips on respect, I was a patron, never disrespect patrons.\n3.  The bartender is rude, oldest son but he is alright once you get service.\n4.  John the doorman is a good guy, I feel bad that the bar gives him little authority, thank you for telling the smokers to smoke away from you.\n5.  Clean the place up, it doesn't hurt to replace the carpet and decorations every ten years.\n6.  The place would be ergonomic if they moved the bar to a corner. May fit more pool tables and patrons.  \n7.

But this place, you get to hear the crowd rock out to the singer like they're famous or something. Had a really great time. Drinks were reasonably priced and service was pretty awesome.  Had an Audrina look alike server!! Looked the same but 10x funnier and 10x nicer! (Yes I used to watch the hills, does this make me less of a man?) I would definitely come back for her.

The place is a total dive bar and lounge. I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THAT AS IT JUST ADDS TO THE ATMOSPHERE.  My issue was with the the DJ NAZI/ simpleton programmer.  The guy does not play your songs unless you bribe him.  BEWARE: The guys name is George Kennedy , he is a white haired, white bearded old man ( approx 60+) and he will promise that you are close to being the next act, but he is LYING!!!! We were there for 4 hours and only got to sing 2 songs out of the 4 songs that we requested and we had to bribe him $10 bucks just to sing the second song...what a $!^%$@!!! Clearly he is making a decent living in this recession that we are all suffering from!  There are so many better places in San Diego to Karaoke than this lame place that employs jerks like this.  SIng your heart out elsewhere! You will be happier for it!",

I don't have to dress up, I don't have to be good at Karaoke, I don't have to wait in line, I don't have to fight for a pool table, and I usually get a few free drinks on any given evening. While the place smells like moldy feet, there's a homeless guy who follows me around and grunts at me every time I'm there, and the bathroom is gross with an auto-flush that must have a broken sensor because it always scares the crap out of me, I keep on going back. The $5 cover isn't really a big deal, the drinks will knock you on your ass, the karaoke is endlessly entertaining, and the conversation is far more engaging than at oh, say...P.B. Bar & Grill (which I also think smells like feet...). What's also different about the Lamplighter is that most of the patrons are local regulars (so my advice is to avoid following anyone home unless you really want to end up face to face with the guy you \"forgot\" to call back next time you show up at the bar)!! =)",

We arrived around 11pm, waited around until almost 12:30am only to find that the karaoke guy had no intention of playing our song. We had a large group, about 6 of us- and 2 more joined us, so drinks were flowing and money was being spent waiting for the debut of Em & Natalie but no such luck. I went over to ask for timing- and he was rude and dismissive to me, and when Emily asked when her song would be played he pretty much demanded a tip. Keep in mind he is clutching a $20 in his hand and sounding like Christmas Grinch. I am not in the practice of tipping for services that have not been performed- much less rewarding bad behavior. He allowed two horrible singers two go twice (even assisted with singing along for a poorly chosen Billy Ocean song), while the crowd made rumblings about the song being \"gay\". Yes, it was a Friday night and the crowd was tight-but no one wants to move out of the way- they want you to bump them so that they have an excuse to fight...I guess we should have known calamity would ensue when we walked up and the police were there, I certainly wont make that mistake again. (Apparently someone on staff hit a girl but was \"provoked' by her comments. Umm Excuse me, when is it ever okay for a male staff member or any representative of an establishment to touch a patron?) Don the big body bouncer outside with the great buzz cut is the only classy thing about this establishment, and if I can I will steal him away to a classier environment. He is the only redeeming quality, and lucky for us he is transportable-  Karaoke Scrooge Senior is heartless and rude. Don't go- and for goodness sakes dont go on a Friday or Saturday when you will have to pay to play.\nUseful 3\nFunny\nCool\nJoe S.\nBusiness Owner\n12/21/2009\nDear unsatisfied customer,",

At 10:30, when some other people had been up 2-3 times, I checked in with the D.J., a gruff old guy, who let me know in no uncertain terms that if we wanted to get a chance to sing, we had to pay him a bribe to do so.  I gave him 5 bucks, but he said that wouldn't do the trick.  If we weren't with a group fired-up for karaoke, I'd have grabbed my fiancee and left.  I wound up paying a total of $20 in \"tip\" money to this guy, who only let my group have 2 songs the whole night.

It was hard to get to the bar, and when we finally squeezed our way in, waited about 10 minutes to even get a look from the bartender.  He seemed annoyed to be there, and annoyed to have to serve us.  I left with a sore throat -- not from singing karaoke -- but from having to yell in my conversation with my friend, because the karaoke on the OTHER side of the bar was so loud and quite frankly, obnoxious.",

                  "review": "It's taken me a while to finally write this review.  What sent me over the edge? Well last Wednesday I randomly went there and I was the DD for my group, which I told the bartender. He in turn charged me $2 for a single glass of WATER, from the wand...or maybe that $2 was because I asked for it with lime. That's the last straw, I'm never putting another dime into this place. That's on the same level of sleaze as taking a 24 hour AA chip in exchange for a drink.\n\nI really wanted to like the Lamplighter. And I'll admit when I first moved to San Diego I did like it. But then I went to ANY other karaoke place, and found Lamplighter to be lacking in every way.\n\nThe Bar:\n* The bar is cash only, meaning they control the ATM and are making an extra 25% off of every sucker that takes a $20 out. It's 2011 get with the program, the only bars that still do this are trying to avoid taxes, launder money or are looking to ripoff the costumer.\n* With the exception of Stone Pale Ale, their beer selection sucks. At least get some bottles of something that isn't fizzy yellow water.\n* For a place that strictly does karaoke the sound sucks. If you're on the other side of the bar, don't expect to hear your name if you're called on a busy night.\n* They used to (or still do, I haven't been on the weekend in ages) charge a cover on the weekend. It's karaoke, what are you covering? And the fact that they would have ever done this just shows you how hungry they are for money.\n* They obviously don't reinvest their profits in the bar. As shown by the sound system.\n\nThe Karaoke:\n* They have a decent selection of karaoke songs. Nothing rare, nothing to write home about. I think people get caught up because they see the size of the books and think, wow this must be amazing. When you start looking you'll see they have a few different version of many songs from different karaoke creators. Most karaoke places cull through those and get rid of the bad ones. Making it on par with the selection of most every other place I've seen. Hell, some places, like at Bar Eleven will get you any karaoke song you want that they don't have on the spot.\n* If you get skipped on a busy night because you couldn't hear the host, some of the hosts make you jump to the back of the line.\n*if it's super busy don't expect to sing more than one song in a night unless you have a $20 you're willing to drop on it.\n*if you come after 11 on a Friday or Saturday night, don't expect to sing.\n*expect to hear the same songs night after night (hope you like Don't Stop Believing, Dead or Alive, and Sweet Caroline)\n\nThe People:\n* My friends call this place the Tramplighter, and for good reason.\n* The bartenders don't cut off drunk people, so expect to see vomit in and around the toilets, drunken barely able to stand women and drunken bros that will hit on anything with lady parts.\n*The turnover is good and you get a lot of randoms because of the 7 day a week karaoke thing.\n*if you have a flannel shirt you just bought lamplighter is a good place to blend in\n* Most people are talkative, and you can start random conversations",

                  "review": "I've gone to the Lamplighter on and off for about 9 years so I think my assessment of this place is more than fair.  It's in my neighborhood and convenient.  The bartenders are good enough guys, and they pour heavy.  A few of them get up and sing very well, I might add.  This place is usually fine on weekdays, or if you are only interested in having some drinks and don't mind trying to have a conversation while listening to the screams of drunk  patrons.   If you are looking to sing...go elsewhere, or be prepared to shell out some cash for bribes.   The sound is turned up way too loud for the music...very reminiscent of the KEN CLUB.  Friday and Saturdays are the worst.  Super crowded, hot and way too many drunken singers who are less than entertaining.    I think it's entirely LAME and  SHADY of the DJ to require frequent and sizable tips in order to sing.   I went to my friend's (a regular I might add) birthday at the Lamplighter and gave the shyster dj $20 so she could sing...I found out later she gave him $15...and he still didn't call her name.  Apparently, he's only taking 50's?  She is there 1-2 times a week.  I'm not saying you shouldn't tip the guy, but I think it's ridiculous, unscrupulous and crappy of them to allow the same people to go up over and over again.  It was my sister's birthday and she really wanted to karaoke, so we arrived at 10 pm on a Sunday.  We waited two hours for her to sing. A SUNDAY!   The place wasn't even crowded.  We were in a group, spending money on drinks and not one of us got chosen to sing.  If you like stiff, reasonably priced drinks...great.  If you want to sing...go to the Tickled Trout, Henry's Pub,  or the Carriage House.  The Carriage house has it's share of creepy, creepy men who look like they are still living in the 70's, but at least you don't have to wait hours to sing.  I've never had to tip or bribe the dj's at other karaoke establishments...I'm done with this place.",

                  "review": "I have been to this bar about 6 times since May 2009. I can't say I have ever been impressed. I really like the people and I enjoy the bartenders. It's inexpensive and not too far from where I live. What I am very diasppointed with is the KJ's I have encountered. The bar already pays them to be there and let people sing. However, when I roll up at 9pm and put in 3 songs and only get to sing one around midnight as I have seen the same people keep getting to sing before me is a bit frustrating. I recently learned that the only way they will let you sing more than once is it you tip them. Now, last time I checked on what the definition of a tip is. It is a gratiude for their services. Thanking them for being great at what they are doing. Not something required in order to get service. I would gladly tip KJ's I have in the past where I used to live. I do not think it should be expected, demanded, or the only way you actually get to sing. What really pissed me off was when he let the drunkest girl I had ever seen go up on stage and make a complete ass of herself fake orgasiming all over the stage for the length of a song. Instead of saying, wow this girl is wasted perhaps, A. we should take her off the stage to keep her from futher embarassing herself and the reputation of this bar. and B. Perhaps we should put someone up there who isn't so wasted they can't sing or read the screen. I had one of the regulars there actually go up to the KJ and ask him if I could sing, I said no, because that't not how a KJ should be. He should be putting people into rotation, and keep on that rotation. I have been there and see 3 differant KJ's all of them have the same attitude. I will not be going back nor will I be telling people to go here.",

The service is always attentive but not overbearing, and some of the waiters know us now because of how often we come.\n\nBrunch is excellent. There is almost always availability for the patio or inside, and we've had everything from the tuna avo toast to the vanilla pancakes. My partner loves their tomato dassi scramble. Service is always on point and our dogs love the patio.\n\nWe also love coming for dinner. Standouts include the branzino, the pizza, and the fusili pasta. Love that the pasta comes with a condiment tray that includes parmesan, red peppers, and ranch (!).",

I came here on a Sunday with some friends for an early dinner.  \nThe hostess was very polite and sat us promptly outdoors at a table away from others per my request which I really appreciated.  \nFor cocktails I had the Verona which was delicious and my girlfriend had the Roman Forum which was was just as good. Then our guests had the Cantalupo and the Cinque Terre.\nWe started with two orders of Calamari, Cheesy Garlic Bread and the Grilled Lamb Chops.  The calamari was very tender but perhaps over cooked if that makes sense.  It was extra crispy which we all enjoyed however some pieces tasted a bit burnt; as if the oil got to hot. The Lamb was amazing. Cooked to perfection and the salsa verde was a perfect accompaniment.  My friends liked the Cheesy Garlic Bread but it just looked like a roll with garlic butter.  For our main course I had the Puttanesca which at most restaurants is disappointing but this was special.  It was not a traditional puttanesca but what it was, was delicious.  My girlfriend had the Bolognese which she really enjoyed.  Again I am usually disappointed in most restaurant's bolognese was this one again was surprisingly very good. Our friends had the Merguez Sausage Cavatelli which they said was delicious and the Herbed Parppadelle which was a bit disappointing.\nFor dessert we all finished with ice cream which was all amazing.\nOur server was very attentive and made great suggestions and the food was coursed perfectly.\nI'll definitely be back to try the other items.  I can't wait.\nCheesy Garlic Bread",

But if breakfast could all be like what I had this weekend at Cardellino, I'd change my tune in a heartbeat.\n\nParking. Good luck. I parked in a paid lot across the street. $3 an hour. Not bad. Don't know what parking tickets costs these days but I'm sure it's more than $9. Or walk. I saw street parking blocks away. Too lazy to walk.\n\nReservations. Make 'em. I don't remember seeing empty tables. And they kept turning over. This was for brunch. Maybe it's slower between peak periods. Plus you can specify indoors or out.\n\nService. I'm so bad at names. I don't remember her name but she was good. Attentive or present when needed. Only needed her once but it wasn't for anything missing or a problem. Just wanted clean plates going from one dish to another.\n\nFood. Like I said - I don't usually eat breakfast. However, I enjoyed the Khachapuri and Cinnamon Roll. The French Toast was good. Not a fan of the Fried Chicken. Seems like nuggets. Not bad. Just not my cup of tea. Drink - only had one. Driving. Being responsible. Nicely balanced. Not too boozy. But not watered down either.\n\nWill definitely be back\nSee all photos from Ran C. for Cardellino",

I was able to get a table for 9 outside and they were so kind about it. The drink choices are superb. Great wine list and their cocktails are yummy. In fact, Cardellino makes one of the best Aperol Spritzes I have ever had.\n\nThe service was great. We never had our glasses empty for long and the dirty dishes were swept away timely.\n\nThe food was definitely above average. The cauliflower appetizer dish is hands down the best thing they have there. If I wasn't surrounded by 8 other women, I may have grabbed the plate and licked it. No shame. The lamb chop was on the gamey side. I didn't love it. The penne vodka was decent. I don't want to ever go to a restaurant and feel like I could make it better or at least as good myself at home. I wanted something special.\n\nI didn't try the pizzas (I am gluten free) but they all got great reviews. I heard good things about the butternut squash pasta as well. Very fall!  And of course, the desserts are great!  Mr Trustee next door is spectacular for soft serve. So great experience overall!  A true neighborhood gem. You might find me there licking my cauliflower plate!\nSee all photos from Smitha A. for Cardellino",

But I am usually early, it only started to fill up after we were seated and eating.  My friend and I enjoyed our meal.  We both are not strong finishers, so we had our leftovers to go.   Unfortunately, our server gave each of us the wrong ones. I only found out when I opened it at home.  My friend got my leftover potatoes and I got her leftovers (half her dish).\n\nI definitely need to try them for Dinner one of these days.

I ordered the Ahi Crostino which was a thick sliced and toasted piece of French bread coated with a tarragon aioli, spread with luscious ripe avocado, crisp pancetta, perfectly seared ahi and olives, dressed greens and cherry tomatoes.  Every bite was perfectly crafted.  \n\nMy husband ordered the fried chicken sando.  Take a buttery brioche bun and smother it with a Calabrian chili aioli, topped with a juicy crispy coated chicken breast drizzled with hot honey and topped with a cool slaw.  Pair that with their fries that should be illegal because they're so good and you've got the best meal ever.  \n\nI'll definitely return to check out their dinner menu of arancini, meatballs and cacio e pepe.

                  "review": "8 photos\nI come here. A lot. Probably more than any other restaurant in all of San Diego because the food is the best, the staff is the best and the atmosphere is just right. This restaurant is a part of the Trust restaurant group, so this shouldn't really come as a surprise to those familiar with their other establishments. Every dish is made with love and sophistication. They also have a bakery AND an ice cream shop so it's a one stop shop and most items are made in house. Did I mention they also have a retail shop for their wine?\n\nSome of my favorite things here:\n- The green scramble served during brunch. It's funky, yet hearty, yet healthy, yet delicious. I like to order it with a side of their homemade sourdough bread + seasonal jam.\n- The carbonara! The chef loves salt and has a heavy hand in this dish, but to me, it is perfection.\n- The branzino! It's one of their specialities so if you're here for dinner, you should order it. It's great to split between two people and then explore some of their starters and salads.\n- I can't remember if they call it a tomato salad or bruschetta, but it involves heavy amounts of fresh tomatoes, garlic, olive oil and creamy cheese on toasted, house-made bread.\n- They also serve their pizza with a trio of ranch, Parmesan and crushed red pepper which only makes me love them more.\n\nSometimes I come here just for cocktails and dessert and in those instances I usually order their more modern interpretation of the tiramisu. The bartender also makes a phenomenal espresso martini.\n\nI mostly write this review because it feels wrong not to, but I hope that it continues to be somewhere that I can walk right into without a reservation or a wait. So please visit Cardellino! But unlike me, do so in moderation. Thanks.\nSee all photos from Liz R. for Cardellino",

At no time a manager or floor supervisor approached our table, (maybe afraid of us). $200 at the door + traveling, I have been working in the food and Beverage industry for 40 + years as a chef and F&B director,and love to experience new places, I certainly hope that our evening  was an unusual one . personalty we will not go back  our sponsor to our friends Cardellino\nCheers",

                  "review": "I've lived maybe a mile away for the past 3 years and feel so stupid for not having stopped by sooner. It was one of those places you always pass by and say \"maybe we'll try it someday!\" but then kinda forgot about shortly after.\n\nOn Valentine's Day (Monday) evening we sporadically decided to grab dinner. We parked nearby and walked up expecting to be turned away since we didn't have reservations, but they actually had open bar seating which was first come, first serve, and we were able to sit right away.\n\nService was great. The hostess at the front was very welcoming and the bartenders were just as friendly -- not to mention efficient! They balanced taking orders, making drinks, and sometimes chatting those at the bar up here and there so well. I'd like to thank them for making the experience so great even on a night where they were swamped and likely very stressed.\n\nWe ordered:\n- Roasted Bone Marrow: This was AMAZING. The way they prepared this marrow was really just perfect, with the touch of lemon on top fixing the issue I sometimes encounter of the bite feeling too fatty. I was very skeptical about the cranberry & onion preserves but it complemented the marrow so well.\n\n- Herbed Pappardelle: The pork on this dish was perfectly seasoned and tender. I loved that the pappardelle was al dente and tasted fresh. The crumbs on top provided a crunch that made every bite satisfying, but not too  indulgent.\n\n- Merguez Sausage Cavatelli: Another excellent dish, and very unique. It was like a hybrid between a pasta dish and a soup, with a very loose tomato-based sauce thickened by burrata. The cavatelli was perfectly cooked and had a great texture. This one is really difficult to describe, but definitely something I would say is a must try.\n\n- Ricotta Cheesecake: A home run dish. The cheesecake was rich and creamy, and just when you thought it might get too decadent, the pistachio crust comes in and provides the nuttiness that mellows out the bite. The ice cream used had a great flavor and paired perfectly with the cheesecake, though was maybe a bit icier than I usually prefer. I recommend using the cannoli crisp as a vessel to hold a piece of cheesecake, a bit of ice cream, and a dip of the chocolate cream.\n\nI was so impressed with the quality of everything we ordered. The only disappointment I had was how I had overlooked the place so many times before. We won't be making the same mistake again, and will be back as often as possible.",

No description.  But I'm hungry.\n\nThe description; \"fried, smashed, fried again, rolled with pork, garlic and peppers\".\n\nI'm intrigued.\n\n\"Potatoes\" come out and they look pretty good.\n\nThen I bite into the crunchy, garlic, sweet pepper potatoes that are still perfect inside.\n\nMy eyes begin to roll back into my head, my toes curl, my fingers begin to tingle and I'm nearly transported to planet Shut-The-Front-Door have I never had a good potatoe until this very moment?\n\nI nearly forgot the main dish (a very good wild mushroom omelette), and my beer.\n\nMy partner of many years asks to share and I contemplate stabbing her with a fork in defense of these sent-from-heaven \"potatoes\".  \n\nI'm looking back on life thinking that perhaps it's had no defining moment until just now with these \"potatoes\".\n\nI'm looking around, wondering if the expression on my face is causing concern among the other guests.  \n\nNow, it's not to say the food wasn't great, because it was.  Nor that the service wasn't wonderful, because it was.\n\nBut I'm thinking they should just say \"shut up, sit down, order the 'potatoes' and then leave us to our moment of pure bliss.\n\nSeriously.

We then waited over 15 minutes for anyone to even come by to get drinks, or bring water (spoiler, she didn't even bring water). That took so long that of course we ordered everything on that one stop. It was another 10 or so min before (some of) our drinks came and our food didn't come until we'd been seated over 45 minutes. And this was breakfast. My latte didn't arrive until AFTER the food. So I was sitting with water only for over 45 minutes.\n\nOn the other hand, the food was great. The fried chicken with French toast was a five star dish. Both things were amazing on their own but in a bite together - WOW! I just wish I hadn't agreed to share it with my husband . We also got the breakfast croissant sandwich which was very good, and we are very into breakfast croissants! I thought the potatoes were okay, mostly because I didn't love the spicy sauce. But the crispness was perfect. My husband loved the potatoes. He said his Bloody Mary was okay.\n\nI really want to go back to try their dinner but if the wait times were like this for brunch I'm worried what they'd be like for dinner. Not sure I could even get my husband to go back at all.",

The whole roasted cauliflower had a Mediterranean flare and was packed with so many different flavors that complimented each other perfectly. This dish was so unique and we absolutely loved it.

We got the calamari, which was decent and the garlic bread, which reminded me more of a dinner roll that was topped with garlic, but still pretty good. We all got pasta dishes for an entree, and that's where the problem was. The short rib Pappardelle didn't really meet my expectations, the short rib was fatty and had a grey tint to it, and not much of a sauce. The pasta itself was decent, but again, none of it was super delicious and indulgent- which is what I'm looking for when I dine at an Italian place. We all got ice cream for dessert- they have a creamery attached to the restaurant. The ice cream was very good, although pricey. The ambiance inside was nice and our server was excellent. We want to go back to give it another shot, and maybe try the pizza. But I don't think I'll be ordering a pasta dish again.",

Tonight I hope for Proscuito di San Daniele to be as good because how could it be bad if it is imported from Italy ?!.\n\nAlso Grilled Mediterranean Branzino was good; I had it twice on different occasions .\n\nI sampled Grilled Lamb chop/Antipasti from my friend's plate and i liked it, the sauce was delish.\n\nRed wine/happy hour/Barbera's good.\n\nMy child ordered Fusilli Alfredo from Kids menu - no flavor - not good.\n\nCheese platter from Happy Hour Menu was dry, strawberries were tasteless and blackberries were not so much different; the honey comb  tasted right, but the jam had some unidentified particles in it that I wanted to spit out and I had. Not good.\n\nWhere is our Proscuitto?!\n\nService : one time it is awesome, another time I want to get up and show what the hospitality is all about, like it was today omg: a girl/our server just showed up and brought the  plates. Sometimes it is good and sometimes it's not.\n\nWhere is our Proscuitto?\n\nIs a Baguette that came with Prosciutto had to be burnt, really?!.\nA server/runner proceeded to explain how it was the Italian style for a baguette to be burnt, but when I was to take a photo of the burn on the baguette he rushed the plate/wooden board to the kitchen to see \" what could be done\"\n\nWe've gotten a warmed baguette and the manager had apologised.\n\nNext time I will order Procscuitto only and lots of wine . It came with the garlicky pickled mozzarella cheese ( we didn't eat half of it and our waitress never has asked if we wanted to go  - grr). Even tough Mozzarella was a bit salty for my taste (and i love salt) it was rather enjoyable .\n\nTheir baguettes should be purchased from Bread and Cie so they taste good.\n\nNothing can compare to Bronx Pizza in San Diego.\n\nHere, the other night,  I ordered a pizza with broccoli and it was a disaster a big NO - NO - what was I thinking - pizza with broccoli  !?  \nAlso when I looked at the neighbouring tables i couldn't help but noticing that the neighbour's' pizzas were burnt too. Not good.\n\nMaybe their chef is in love: burnt food and too much salt?! Many reviews I read remarked on it as well. Being in love is good. Burnt salty food is not good.\n\nOn the positive note: i love the ambiance/high ceiling/music/napkins/glasses/silverware and it is only 2 min walk from home, so I better stop complaining or else the next time they will shut their door into my  face!!",

Comparable to Wayfair pastry, coppa vida, etc.\n\nWe didn't come for dine-in, just came for some pastries and coffee with our toddler.\n\nThe cronut bites are the best sweet breakfast treat i've ever had. They're like puffy pieces of cinnamon toast crunch. Could toss these back for hours. The breakfast sandwich (not fresh, reheated from behind counter) was standard. The bacon was really really really crispy and delicious. The rest of it was okay.\n\nThe coffee was special stuff, definitely up there with blue bottle and coava or above even.

We'd been wanting to try this place for a while and they finally opened their indoor dining so we came in for a midweek date night. Here are the highlights!\n\nDrinks:\nCinque Terre- bourbon, aperol, lemon, honey. Excellent! Super well balanced, not too boozy, great balance of citrus and sweet. For the \"something sweet\" bourbon lovers out there\n\nRoman forum: their take on the old fashion with the aromatic Rosemary; again, very well balanced and a pleasure to sip\n\nSt. Mark's square: their take on a Manhattan with blood Orange amaro and chocolate butters; perfect for a Manhattan lover and the sweet vermouth ties perfectly with the rye; most booze-forward since there's no ice to dilute it\n\nValley of temples: bf got this and loved it so much he got 3. This is for the spicy drink lovers out there; rimmed with Calabrian chiles\n\nApps:\nFilet mignon carpaccio- fried shallots, deliciously tender; great flavors\n\nHamachi crudo: good, avo and citrus pieces but could use more citrus\n\nPasta: fusilli piccanti alla vodka- must order! Simple, but the depth of flavor and spice! No need for any additives, because the calabarian chiles really come out to play\n\nPizza: Lamb sausage and rapini-hints of coriander, whole confit garlic, fresh cilantro and crisp rapini pieces with herbed goat cheese; sinful! Also comes with a trio of parm, red pepper flakes, and their house made ranch (asked for some to-go because this ranch was BOMB!)\n\nDessert: Mr. Trustee Spumoni-one of my all time favorite flavor combos: pistachio, amaro cherries, and chocolate with crisp chocolate nibs; perfect to end the night with\n\nAmbiance: may be loud for some, but I loved the music and the vibe. It's hip, service was spot on, and the food was just outstanding. The Trust Group really knows what they're doing and I'm already thinking of what I'm trying the next time we come by.\nSee all photos from Jonathan Z. for Cardellino",

                  "review": "3 photos\nI came here for my mom's birthday celebration for a party of 10 people for Saturday brunch. I love the aesthetics of the place. It was airy and spacious and not crowded which is a plus for us. I wanted to try the banana vanilla pancake but I didn't want to commit to it as my main meal, so we all took a bite and passed it around. The pancakes were light and fluffy and it's good enough to be shared as a breakfast app. We got the nuts on the side since my niece is allergic. I actually liked that the nuts were coated in a sugar coating but it wasn't overly sweet. Then we were served our main entree.  Mine was the green eggs and avocado bowl. At first blush, it can be overwhelming with so much green that you may be concerned that the will be too earthy. But this was not so. I got this dish with egg whites and the spinach, kale and salsa verde added a nice flavor. I ordered some sourdough on the side and this had a crisp top and chewy middle. My daughter loved the prosciutto hash. From my one taste, the flavor combo of the aioli, pesto, potatoes, peppers, runny egg and arugula worked well with one another. Again we felt that a side of sourdough was necessary as an accompaniment. Overall, we were all pleased with our brunch. This is a good restaurant to get brunch especially since you can reserve ahead of time.",

My wife and order pretty much the same thing when we dine in or take out there; green eggs, double stack pancakes, banana bread, and a side of potatoes. The past 3 weekends, the pancakes are over cooked where it's dark brown/black, and the soft scrambled eggs are light brownish and rubbery. Come on guys, I get that you're busy at times but at least keep the food quality consistent. My wife and I will need to break up with you guys for a bit and hopefully things will improve again otherwise we will need to total divorce.",

The inside of the restaurant is nicely done.  It's not like trendy decor but it's chic and it's  a nice place to come for both date or family dinner.  \nWhile we were at the bar, I ordered mocktail and my friend ordered old fashion.   After 10-15 mins, we got to be seated at our table.\nWe ordered: carpaccio, fig and walnut pizza, puttanesca pasta.\nCarpaccio was delicious, it had a little bit of creamy spicy sauce, fried onion, fermented mushroom.  I never had these combination and it was really good. It was a pretty big plate probably enough to share with 3 people.  Fig pizza was delicious, but the puttanesca was our favorite.  It's with black pasta, and the shrimp was cooked perfectly and the seasoning for the sauce was well done. Nothing was too salty and everything had great flavor.   For dessert we ordered some kind of cream custard with rosemary cookie which was very good. The food did take a while to get because it was pretty busy especially this time of the year with lots of big parties, but it didn't bother us since we were having a good conversation. Overall, very satisfied with the service and food, atmosphere so will be back!",

                  "review": "Only been here once (for dinner last night), but it was so good I just had to write a review.\n\nFor an appetizer:\nI ordered the Prosciutto San Daniele.   The prosciutto and baguette were very good, but as good as they were it was the marinated fresh mozzarella that really made this dish shine....the mozzarella itself was very good quality, and the spicy marinade that it was served in made it one of the tastiest items that my mouth has ever had the pleasure of meeting.  \n\nFor my main:\nI had heard about bucatini pasta a couple months back on The Sporkful podcast (the \"spaghetti sucks\" episode), but had never recalled seeing the pasta on a menu before.   And now a couple of months later here I am looking at the Cardellino menu where I see \"Bucatini alla Porcini,\" with a unique toppings list of \"poached hen egg, foraged mushrooms, spring onion, chiles, cured yolk\".      My curiosity piqued by the podcast, combined with savory sounding toppings made this a dish that I knew I had to order; and boy am I glad I did.   It was unlike any pasta dish I have ever had, and I found every bite deliciously satisfying.    \n\nThe other three folks in my party enjoyed everything they had as well, which included a pizza, the filet mignon carpaccio, and the mortadella tortellini.   The one disappointment that one diner had was the \"Baked Focaccia\" --- the menu simply said that it was baked focaccia with dipping sauce; what the menu left out is that it was covered with grated cheese, and the person who ordered is allergic to dairy.    Hopefully management will update their paper menus to add the fact that the bread is topped with grated cheese.\n\nThe servings of appetizers and mains were all plentiful.\n\nI enjoyed the vibrant atmosphere.    Music was played at a fairly high volume (not loud enough to make you yell or anything, but if you are expecting a quiet romantic place this would not be the place).    One person in my party found the metal chairs at our high-top table somewhat uncomfortable, while I on the other hand actually found them to be quite comfortable.",

Soft bun, charred thick patty medium done, their onions were so good (maybe pickled and caramelized?). It was not too salty, which a lot restaurant burgers are, and the sauce was not overpowering. All ingredients were balanced, but the cheese was not very memorable which I'm not too mad at (maybe that's why it's not as salty?). The garlic fries could've been more garlicky and they might've given me the ends of a batch cause there were lots of small pieces.\n\nThere's a nice farmhouse theme and relaxing vibe inside which we thought was nicer than the outside seating. My friend had one of their salads which she enjoyed, but maybe too much spinach? I'm curious to try their other menu items, but would gladly have another burger.",

There were four of us so we shared a ton of food. The tuna tartare and the Arancini were our favorite starters. We ordered the lamb sausage and rapini pizza as well as the salsiccia pizza which were both incredible. Our server Geoff was the star of the evening though. He was on top of everything from water to beverages, clearing and resetting our table, and coursed our food out perfectly. We didn't feel rushed at all and never had more than two dishes on the table at a time. I definitely recommend this place. Definitely ask for Geoff!\n\nOh also - Tuesdays they do 50% off bottle prices!",

Carbonara should be like creamy cheese and melt in your mouth, whether you use cream or not.  It was just oil that didn't even stick to the pasta and the whole dish had no flavor.  Trust charges $17.00 a plate and what came out  was a child's portion.  Maybe your chef was off tonight but if you serve that garbage nightly, shame on you.  The waitress was wonderful hence the 3 stars.  We might try again in the new year for lunch?  Beware, they also charge you for bread and add in a 4% Living Wage Fee.  Really, not cool at all unless it goes directly to the nice waitress.",

                  "review": "Let me tell you about a pleasant surprise this place turned out to be. I don't mean I had low expectations, no, instead, I had no idea about this place to begin with.\n\nOn Friday (07/30) a group of us were having trouble finding a place to eat. We stopped in the area, late in the evening around 830pm and put our names down for a reservation somewhere else. We walked around the area for a bit and came across Cardellino. We approached, were asked what the wait time was for 4, and they said immediate if we wished to sit outside, which we did.\n\nAmbiance inside sounded somewhat lively, and that patio was more relaxed and quiet. On a warm summer night it was perfect. The wait staff was knowledgeable and fired off some recommendations and personal favorites. The rest of the staff we encountered were friendly and polite.\n\nAs for the dinner menu, we were told some of the pastas might be on the small side, intending your group to order several and share.\n\nFor starters, I ordered the Prosciutto San Daniele, Cheese Agnolotti, and the Hen Egg pizza to be shared among our group.\n\nProsciutto San Daniele: I expected a small charcuterie board and what I got was a plank, almost the length of the table, filled with prosciutto, in-house made mozzarella, pickled vegetables and baguette. The prosciutto was full of flavor, and the pickled vegetables were very pickled, and very good, but the best thing on this board was the mozzarella. If I could order just a bowl of that I would of.\n\nCheese Agnolotti: let me tell you what, if you love truffle, you'll love this creamy dish like I did. The flavor was powerful and delicious. What really stood out in this 'ravioli' dish was the summer corn. Nice added touch, and this dish, plus the one above are what I could come back for every time.\n\nHen Egg pizza: This was larger than I expected, but not massive. This could also be I was more full when it finally came out than I was when I ordered it. The egg on top was a little soggy in the center of the pizza, but the yolk added an interesting flavor to a pizza I wasn't expecting and was the primary reason I wanted to try it. I'd probably get it again, but they have many more options of interest as well.\n\nOverall, I ordered way too much food, in the good way, expecting smaller portions, but was pleasantly surprised at how much food came with each delicious dish. I highly recommend. I'm even planning on returning for the fried bologna sandwich they serve for lunch and breakfast we were told about.",

The only reservations that were available were late in the evening, so we tried our luck to see if they take walk-ins.\n\nAfter parking across the street, we could see the bakers rolling some dough in the windows outside. A couple of people had just left the bar right when we walked in, so we were in luck! The bartender made my friend a cocktail called High Fidelity, which tasted like a mojito, but sweeter and better.\n\nFor food, we shared the hamachi crudo, 2 grilled lamb chops, mussels, and a caramelized onion pizza. The hamachi crudo was light and refreshing- I loved the fat pieces of crudo paired with the accompanying citrus sauce and slight amount of heat to it.\n\nThe lamb chops were cooked perfectly and very flavorful. The steamed mussels were huge and plump. This dish also came with a couple pieces of grilled bread from their bakery and small pieces of pancetta. We were so glad we got to try some of their fresh bread. Even the broth was delicious and I was pleasantly surprised how good everything tasted so far.\n\nWe were getting a little full by now, but still had our pizza coming. Our bartender put in the order when we were ready, so it did take a while to come out. Our pizza came with proscuitto and pear, but I wish they added more pieces of fruit to it, since I could hardly tasty any. Overall, the pizza was still good though, and it came with a special ranch sauce.\n\nWe saved room for dessert and split the Mr. Trustee's soft serve and chose the Captain Crunch flavor. This was so tiny for the price, but very creamy and delicious. Soon, you will be able to order this treat from the outside windows as well. Looks like the Trust Restaurant Group has another winner on their hands.\nSee all photos from Dung N. for Cardellino",

I also had a robust cappuccino.\n\nWhen they say soft scramble, well they mean it. The eggs were gently scramble over modest heat and were perfectly seasoned. That touch sea salt made the difference.\n\nThe grilled baguette was not only baked in house, but it was fantastic.  The bread had that nice crisp edge yet soft and chewy inside, not to mention that subtle smoky flavor from the grill. The baguette was great eating with the soft scramble.\n\nService was very kind and helpful.\nSee all photos from Jack M. for Cardellino",

                  "review": "5 photos\nCardellino is a new bakery/cafe/restaurant in Mission Hills under the ownership of the Trust Restaurant Group. This neighborhood block has had some recent closures so to see another eatery open was a good sign. The parking situation was atrocious as there aren't enough curbside spots for the number of businesses in this area.\n\nWhen I arrived there was an hour plus wait, and the spots at the bar were all occupied. A few empty two-top tables were available in their designated cafe seating area. Since it was already in the evening, I asked if those spots would be serviced for dinner. The hostesses at the stand weren't sure, but one of the workers who was staffing the service counter confirmed with the kitchen that they could accommodate me.\n\nCasual Italian fare was the theme of the menu. There was a long column of antipasti, followed by a middle section of pizzas and entrees, and then the pastas on the right. I chose the Malfade Nere Alla Puttanesca from the last category. The dish contained ribbon-shaped pasta with shrimp, capers, anchovies, olives, sweet garlic, chili, and a tomato-based sauce. The capers, anchovies, and olives gave the pasta a really deep flavor. The size of the shrimp was rather tiny so they got lost in the serving vessel. I wish the portion size was larger for the $18 price too.\n\nI decided to try the soft serve ice cream from Mr. Trustee's for dessert. There were two flavors, a sorbet and Captain Crunch. I picked the latter for something sweeter to rinse my palate. The small cup was disappointing for $6, but the ice cream was tasty. Overall, I gave the food a three-star rating, however I added another star because of the server who went out of his way to get me seated and served in the cafe area.\nSee all photos from Emmett T. for Cardellino",

Then we had the creste & clam, AMAZING, and then also we ordered a pizza, I can't remember the name but it had sausage, ricotta cheese, and some other deliciousness!\n\nEverything was perfect, I'm so glad we stumbled upon this restaurant & Geoffrey you're an amazing waiter!",

Started off with a spicy calabrian chili tequila drink. Delicious. Tuesday's are half off wine bottles so we definitely took advantage of that. We started off with parker rolls, burrata, meatballs, calamari and the roasted cauliflower. Everything was great, especially the parker rolls. We moved on to pasta afterwards, we had the ala vodka, puttanesca and the carbonara. All of the pasta dishes were exceptional. All the pastas are made fresh in house so definitely something to look over. After that we had the mortadela pizza and the butternut squash pizza. Both pizza had that delicious wood oven taste. The flavors of the butternut squash were right up my alley, a little sweet and savory. We finished off with the tiramisu and a budino with an assortment of their in house made ice creams. Overall the meal was fantastic. Really enjoy everything the trust group does. Would highly recommend.\nSee all photos from Miguel D. for Cardellino",

The sites and sounds create an atmosphere that is energetic and cool, welcoming and stylish.\n\nThe interior is a bit on the very cold side, and the seating is semi-uncomfortable metal seating. I hope they might invest in comfortable seating for guests.\n\nWe ordered the calamari - it had pickled small onions and sweet mini-peppers and greens. I asked for a more tartar-type dipping sauce instead of the hot rich red sauce because I felt there was enough going on with the dish and delicate flavors of the calamari that would have been camouflaged by the red sauce. Instead, I opted for an aioli sauce and added lemon to it. It was a great compliment.\nAlso ordered, was a 'board, with nicely sliced ribbons of prosciutto, pickled veggies, bread, etc., we asked for additional bread [sourdough warmed is preferred with this] and sides of olive oil and balsamic. Very good.\nOne friend got the clams with radiatore [think \"radiator\"].  This dish was a bit over-powering in it's knock-you over the head herbaceousness. Really intense fennel and/or oregano, a lot too strong that the poor little clams were clamoring for attention!  \n\nNext, I ordered the 'modern' take on Carbonara. I have to say when the plate arrived [for $16] I was searching for the food. It was plated in a somewhat, \"pho\" bowl. I think this would be much better on a flat plate. It was more of a pasta alla' burro. because it was loaded with butter with an egg yolk sitting atop the very small mound of capellini. Yes, not even thin spaghetti, this was very fine strands that I have to be critical and ask the chef to change this up. This delicate fine pasta is the wrong choice for such a heavy and rich 'sauce' content. I mean, you are already coating my palate unnecessarily with so much butter-~ that even the prosciutto is angry because it's flavor is undetectable. Big question: \"Where is the PEPPER!?\" MIA!  : [    This was a modern miss.......and unfortunately, the pasta was over-cooked.  \nPasta for Carbonara should be very al dente once hitting the saute pan, the pepper should be plentiful, as the name, \"carbon - ara\" and have a pleasing bite.\n\nThe tiramisu and the dessert that was made with earl grey tea was really excellent.\n\nThe wine list was very extensive, but the beer list lacked styles other than heavy IPA, and other strong pales.\n\nI'll definitely be back. Overall, I recommend this new eatery!",

Loma and happy to make the trip to the old neighborhood for this deliciousness.\nI'm an East Coast Italian who knows good Italian food. Cardellino isn't good; it's EXCELLENT (a term I do not use often).\nAfter trying almost everything on the menu, not one dish disappoints. Something as simple as a chopped salad is incredible. Hands down the tastiest salad I've ever eaten. The fusilli alla vodka is my favorite dish on the menu. It's jam packed with amazing flavors and a subtle kick.\nEveryone we've encountered from staff to management has been very warm and friendly.\nThis place gets very busy so make a reservation and enjoy the best dining experience in San Diego!",

Now for the nitty-gritty...\nThe patio seating is fantastic and it was so refreshing to sit outside and enjoy our surroundings and feel like we were having a normal night out during all of this pandemic BS.\n\nWe ordered the Hamachi Crudo, roasted broccoli, and the calamari to begin with. Our appetizers were exceptional, the calamari was perfectly fried with beautiful slices of fresh peppers and deep-fried lemon slices. The Crudo was fresh and lively, the broccoli was flavorful, crisp,  and not over done. The appetizers were absolutely the standouts of our meal.\n\nWe ordered the ribeye and fried chicken for our entr\u00e9es. Both of the entr\u00e9es were so overly salted that they were not palatable. I love salt, it is one of my best friends and I use it without spare on just about anything I'm eating. I salt each of my chips Individually before I feel like they are ready for salsa. It is not often and closer to never that I would send something back for being salty.\n\nThe ribeye was very disappointing. It was plated very sloppily and I felt like the entire plate hid a piece of meat that wasn't cooked enough and was not presented with any attention to detail. We ordered medium rare and it was very rare- almost blue. Because of all the topping, it just seemed like a mess to re-cook. Our server was kind enough to send it back for some extra heat, but by then we were done and took it to go.\n\nThe fried chicken had rave reviews on Yelp, and came out looking delicious- but was also too salty to eat. We tore the skin and ate some of the meat, but it was a bummer.\n\nI'd come back to have appetizers and drinks only, because they were worth the trip!",

It was fantastic, walking in I knew I was going to order a pasta; but then I saw my friend's pizza and still ordered the pasta plus got a pizza to take home for the next day.\n\nService is outstanding, always checking to see if you need anything else.  Great happy hour at the bar also.  Atmosphere was upbeat and cheerful.\nOh yes, they have a bakery also.\n\nThey are owned by Trust Restaurants, can't wait to try the other co owned restaurants by them soon.",

She ordered the fusilli piccanti alla vodka. I had the lamb sausage & rapini pizza and a glass of rose. And wow! It was fabulous!  The flavors were amazing and so much of it is homemade. It's food from the heart, genuine. I'd love to go back weekly. The servers were knowledgeable, friendly, and down to earth. It was a great experience!",

I had the bacon onion omelette with potatoes and it's was exceptional! Looking so forward to having dinner there soon.\n\nOnly thing I'd not recommend is the cinnamon roll, it was very dry, cool and served with ice cream.

The calamari was good but the breading reminded me of fried chicken so I probably wouldn't order that again. Definitely coming back for the pizza athough.\nCalamari fritti.

Buyer beware, they charge $30 for corkage and they also charge a 4%\"living wage\" fee.  It's my fault for not asking what the corkage fee was in advance but it seems pretty high for this level of restaurant.  The living wage fee was also a surprise that was not mentioned by the wait staff.  I would prefer the restaurant just adjust their meal prices to cover the cost of labor or at least tell you in advance you will be paying more than the advertised menu price.  Overall, it seemed a little disingenuous to not put these costs up front instead of surprising on the bill.",

This was our first time visiting Mission Trails and we were unsure of where to go and we stumbled upon this place. We were able to get out door seating around 5 pm (Thursday).  They had a happy hour menu from 4-6 we scanned the code once we were seated. We chose to get 1/2 liter of white wine for $13 which is a great deal and the wine was delicious. We got a margarita pizza for $10 and another appetizer which was great but honestly I can't remember the name! We had an amazing time and the staff was amazing.

Lunch starts at 11AM. I had the Burger - American cheese, trg crack sauce, pickled + fried onions, sesame seed bun and fries. This was a perfect dish for me that afternoon. The burger was perfectly cooked medium rare, the pickled + fried onions were a great marriage with the burger and trg crack sauce was is a nice medley of herbs and spices. It's a delicious burger. Plus, the fries were nice and crispy.\n\nThis was my first time at Cardellino, I intend on heading back to try other things on the menu. I trust, Trust to deliver fantastic food and they always do.",

Located in the heart of mission hills, it is an all-day cafe/bakery and restaurant! Boasting an east coast meets west coast style, the space is bright and airy, chic, and modern. We managed to snag reservations for 5 pm last night and we were so incredibly impressed with everything from the service to the food! We were informed by our server that pretty much everything is made in-house (from the bread, cheese, pasta, baked goods, desserts, sauces, you name it!)\nWhat we ordered:\n1) Caesar salad: $13 amazing classic that they nailed with fried anchovies on top!\n2) grilled Colorado lamb chop: $5 each. THIS IS A MUST GET. the lamb was perfectly grilled and seared and bursting with flavor. The chimichurri that accompanied it was the perfect addition to an already perfect bite. If it were socially acceptable, I would marry this dish!\n3) funghi pizza: $19 this pizza has three different types of cheese, roasted mushrooms, soft garlic, the most amazing and fresh ricotta, thyme, pecorino. I've lived in New York, LA and Napa valley, and let me tell you, this pizza was one of the best mushroom pizzas I've had! The crust was perfect and the ranch that came with it was genius! Who doesn't love dipping their crust in ranch?!\n4) malfade nere alla puttanesca: $18 this dish came with shrimp, capers, anchovy, olives, sweet garlic, chili. Each bite was like a symphony in my mouth. Such a delicate balance of flavors from umami, briny, sweet, savory. The bursting of flavors will definitely delight your taste buds!\nThank you to Cardellino for an amazing experience. Our 2020 goal is to try every single item on the menu!\nSee all photos from Eunice H. for Cardellino",

And brunch and espresso??? So much to offer. Mission Hills is really a fun locale and thanks to the Trust Group you now have options on every corner.\n\nOfficial opening is 1/30.\n\nUpdate: tonight is the official opening. We tried the Antipasti plate - check out my photos - such a beautiful presentation  and tasty. We also had the Cesaer Classico. Loved the deep fried anchovies. And the Meatballs!! Yes!! Lots of families, lots of light and airy space. Lots of friends at the bar.

As you enter, you get to see the open kitchen and chefs making the food (ravioli the night I was there).\n\nTried quite a few items - the pizzas were excellent especially the mushroom.   Lamb chops were absolutely brilliant - I could have enjoyed 3 or 4 more.  Pasta was super fresh.  Drinks were exceptional.\n\nThey have a really nice private room for smaller groups.\nChefs making the ravioli\nMushroom pizza",

The location is ideal as it's in the center of Mission Hills in a beautiful building where you can choose to sit outside or inside. The menu is definitely lighter than all of their other restaurants and focuses on the coastal region of Italy. We started with their Palermo cocktail which was light and refreshing. We went on to their Margherita pizza which was the perfect combination of crispy but light and the fresh mozzarella was perfection. Honestly, one of the best Margherita pizzas we have had in a long time. We then decided to move to wine for the rest of our meal and chose the Super Tuscan red they have on draft and it was great. We then shared the Fusili Piccanti alla Vodka and my god it was good. So rich and creamy but yet a small 4 oz portion so you don't overdo it. We end got the Grilled Bronzino and WOW we were impressed. The chick peas gave it a more hearty taste which totally made the dish what it was. We ended the evening with the Rocotta Zeppoles. OMG - little balls of heaven and the lemon flavoring just added the right touch of citrus with such a sweet dish. All in all everything was 5/5 and we were very impressed with the service, timing of each dish that came out and of course the food itself was everything we expected and were hoping for!\nMargherita",

It was a busy night at Cardellino's with an hour wait for a table for two. But scored two seats at the bar with no wait! We started with the citrusy Hamachi Crudo and Mussels with pancetta in a spicy white wine broth. Both delicious and well prepared. Then came our order of lamb chops, covered with chimichurri. They were so flavorful!! I also liked that one could order by the piece. I've only recently started eating lamb and these are the best I've had so far! Lastly came out pancetta and pear pizza. It was a delicate blend of flavors and the crust was quite good and a tad bit chewy, which I like. Overall it was a great dinner! Service was awesome as well. Oh I forgot to mention, for desert we ordered a Mr Tasty cone swirled with vanilla and Cap'n Crunch. The size was a little disappointing. I think I'd skip it next time\nSee all photos from Alicia P. for Cardellino\nUseful 4\nFunny 2\nCool 3",

We ordered a pepperoni pizza to share to see if the lackluster mushroom one we ordered last time was a fluke (in a negative way) and I got the bologna/breakfast sandwich. The pizza was ok. The dough was good but not as good as the mushroom one from last time. The middle of the bologna sandwich basically fell out of the bread and onto the plate when I tried to pick it up. That was disappointing and not the experience I had last time. One thing I've noticed with every Trust Group restaurant is that they use a large amount of salt on their dishes. This was the case in my experience at Rare Society and their namesake restaurant Trust in Hillcrest. Always feel like I'm waking up with a hangover -- even if I barely drink -- which was what happened when I had dinner last time at Cardellino.\nSee all photos from Oso L. for Cardellino\nUseful\nFunny\nCool",

I feel like everything is priced on the high side for what you get so it's not a place you will go to again and again several times a week.\n\nThe pastries I've tried were delicious but priCed where I won't be stopping in everyday. The quality is there so this is great for a once a week splurge.\n\nThe cacio e Pepe on the dinner menu was amazing but the pizza was lackluster. The crust was perfect but the sauce was just ok and the cheese was kind of plastic-y. I definitely want to give their lunch menu a try in the future and think the staff are super accommodating and nice but I don't feel like the it's worth the spend.",

We sat for over 10 minutes before a server came to take our order. Another 10 minutes for drinks. We had to remind them about the bread they promised. Eventually, the food we ordered came out randomly. There was no cadence to the meal as bowls were dropped in front of us. When we made a comment about the service, the server condescendingly informed us that the kitchen was \"busy\".\n\nAs for the food, the highlight was the chopped salad and it was downhill from there. The meatballs were over spiced. The caccio pepe was over cooked to the point that you couldn't twirl it on your fork. By the time the pizza finally came - long after the other items -  we were done. So much anticipation for a new place in the neighborhood that would replace Brooklyn Girl. It's meh, at best.",

Grilled to perfection, another expertly crafted blend of flavor & savory bread. The fries on the side were irresistible, but LOADED with salt- Get ready to down water the rest of the day if you indulge.\n\nI think the menu is a little on the $$$$ for not being a full service restaurant.

Came for Brunch on a Sunday with high hopes..,Let's start with just walking in the door ... weird entrance, from the side where apparently you need to Know what you already want to eat and drink ( from the ridiculously small and pretty much non existent bar menu) and the regular food  menu. Seriously two unappealing sounding cocktails were listed with A few beers & wines on tap. Yup, you order at the counter, pay and take a # and find a seat. I already am hating the concept. Food is served promptly. The Caesar is absolutely basic, overdressed and on the salty side, comes with NO anchovies. The funghi ricotta pizza was magic and the star of the show! Delish with the perfect char on the yummy crust. The Rioja chilaquiles were good, not great. Nice Eggs over easy but an insane tower of jalape\u00f1os over a mountain of chile seasoned tortilla chips that overpowered the flavors of the cilantro & cotija cheese. So you say they have ice cream???  Never saw any desserts except for the most basic pastries & cookies in their bakery when you walk in the door. And, the BAR.... if you can even call it that. It used to be a centerpiece of BG and now it's cut in half with communal dining. It looks ridiculous. Really poor use of the interior space as far as this diner is concerned. Super pricey too. Not happy and won't be back. Good luck with this one Trust group.\nThe funghi pizza with toasted garlic & Ricotta: very good",

Because of the pandemic it hasn't been able to be fully open, but last night we were able to eat inside the restaurant and experience it working on all cylinders.  We had a large party of 8 and everyone was happy with every dish we enjoyed (especially the meatballs and lambchops).  Their service is awesome and their team seems to work with the flow you would expect from a restaurant that has been open for years versus just starting again.  We will definitely continue to return,",

Then the service ... it took 30 minutes to get our glasses of wine which we had ordered at least twenty minutes earlier along with our food order. An hour after we sat down our food had still not arrived. A person in our party went inside to talk to the waiter (we were seated outside) and also talked to the manager. After about five minutes he came back and following him was our waiter and the manager with the food. The pizza was completely burnt and the pasta was just ok. We complained and they comped the pizza (nice gesture). A few minutes later the manager came over to see how things were going and we complained again about the service and she completely threw the waiter under the bus. Not ok as he was doing what he could. They had a kitchen problem not a waiter problem. All in all a one star due mostly to the managers bad attitude and her throwing her staff under the bus. I go to Trust,one of their other restaurants, and have never had a problem like this. Won't go back any time soon! In fact if you want better pizza go to Lefty's across the street.",

The only menu was brunch.\n\nThe margarita pizza was unremarkable with little flavor in the sauce (no fresh tomatoes) or crust. The egg white frittata was not a frittata but  fried egg whites about 1/4 inch thick at most, corn tortilla size. The greens blended in with the egg whites had a less than fresh taste. Arugula on top was fine.\n\nThe Chile verde egg bake was inedible. The meat (?) was dry and over cooked. There was a spice (not hot) that was maybe chili spice but not cooked into the sauce so tasted grainy; not a good flavor. The egg was baked in the middle. It looked More like Chile Colorado than Chile verde.\n\nYou order at the counter, pay and tip before you get food & drink. Big mistake. I picked the 20% expecting some service, but no. You take a number to your table and wait. Water arrived promptly but our drinks did not arrive until after we asked for them after food arrived. Staff was confused about the order, and could not help with drink selections. Nobody mentioned there was a bar in back.\n\nBottom line: maybe it is ok for dinner, but lunch is a huge miss. Try somewhere else.",

Look. I'm no Karen, but in a patio area with at least 15 tables, there was no need to seat anyone that close to me. I'm not one to make a fuss. So I moved away from them. No biggie. I was then roundly ignored, another lady sat herself next to me, so I moved again. And I was ignored again, while the original three selfie and duck lip brigade were doted upon. Paid my tab by walking up to the hostess area, and I'm done. Bummer, because I do like Trust, even if they are pricey, it's generally worth it. I've dined at Trust Hillcrest, and many times, at Fort Oak. Always good experiences, and delicious food. I was quite vexed, as I was looking forward to reading my book, minding my own business, and checking out the small plates. Now I'm down at Harley Gray, well away from anyone else, and having a salad. Damn. I really wanted to try the gnocchi. I'll try again some other day, but today was a major fail.",

They have an onsite bakery and make everything in house. We started with a cocktail at the bar, which was unbalanced and not appealing. The hostess had run out of menus, so we were forced to wait 10 minutes for our table, standing awkwardly by her station. We finally asked if she could just seat us at the table without menus as we were freezing every time the door opened, and she reluctantly agreed. Service was slow and disorganized, no one seems to know anything and there were long pauses between the time we were seated to when our order was taken. The food was very average, we had the Chop salad, hamachi crudo, Spaghetti pomodoro and their version of the Arrabiata - none of the flavors were particularly interesting. No local or organic produce or meat and farm raised fish. Overall, I would not return.",

Went there on a Thursday at 5:30 pm to a half empty restaurant and was told they couldn't seat us until 7:30 pm but we could sit at the bar if we like. We had our 4 month old asleep in a stroller so that wasn't an option. Disappointed by our first attempt at a new neighborhood spot and that the hostess didn't seem to understand that a family couldn't just \"sit at the bar\".",

Between the service, floor-plan and robust menu- I'm happy to give this place 5 stars. The waiting staff was amazing and happy to answer any and all questions with a wealth of knowledge. Petra was our server and she was an absolute delight! We ordered quite a few items and shared between our table. We ordered the bread service, broccoli, grilled baby brie, salsiccia pizza, fusilli piccanti alla vodka and the tiramisu. Everything was bursting with flavor and presentation on point! I will say my only light disappointment is that portions are a bit small for the price. Looking forward to checking out the bakery, ice cream and coffee shop. Also, love that they partnered with our favorite local coffee shop Heartwork!",

I used to be a server at one point in time, so I understand the pressure of just beginning, and making sure everything runs the way it was hoped for. But I just feel like the ball was dropped. I'm hoping it was a one time fluke, because I love a good night out with some great pasta, also with this place being so close. Fingers crossed! Also, I noticed there was a surcharge at the end when I received my bill. What for? The price of minimum wage going up? It's 2020...we all deserve a living wage.\nOverall, I will try again in the near future. Only hoping, next time, it doesn't seem so wishy-washy.",

Pastry Chef Jeremy Harville won my heart years ago with his sticky bun & homemade ice cream available on the Trust brunch menu, and at this new Cardellino location his pasties and soon to be Mr Trustie ice cream are the stars of the show! I've stopped by a few time in the morning to get my work day started and have never been disappointed with the daily pastry selection. You absolutely have to try the Cream Cheese Banana Muffin!!!! I'm obsessed!! I've only been in for dinner once, it was also a great experience. I think it was one of their first nights open and I was very impressed with the level of service and staff knowledge on the menu. General Manager, Taryn Hernandez, was so friendly stopping by our table several times giving outstanding recommendations and to assure we were loving everything.... we were!!! Me and my group of girlfriends can be a bit picky but we all found selections we loved. The Carbonara and the Caramelized Onion Pizza were the big hits for all of us. Over all a great experience anytime of day and I'll be back!",

                  "review": "Very awkward at the \"entry\" to the restaurant because the company obviously wants you to walk straight into the pastry/ junk food counter. There is not enough space to walk in if the hostess is walking to desk or if people are walking out.\n\nThe \" decor\" is what we are used to from this group in Mission Hills : cheap.\nA few plants, empty wooden crate boxes hung on the wall, lots of different light fixtures including a too small \" wagon wheel chandelier \"that belongs in a dude ranch mess hall.\nThe high top table was big enough for 3 but seated 4. The crisp, linen napkins were a nice touch.\nOur waitress had a great smile and was professional and prompt.\nI loved it when she said \" these plates\n( pointing to menu) are small, meant for sharing. Really? What does that even mean?\nI had the mushroom pizza which was OK except that someone in the kitchen decided to sprinkle loads of Oregano on top.....so the whole thing tasted like baked oregano.\nMy husband had a pasta dish. This \" small plate, big enough to share\" was tiny and unremarkable.\nSoft serve ice cream was a nice throw back to earlier times, but at $10.00 each -\nI would rather support Dixie Pops.\nAll in all- very nice waitress, cheap decor,\ntiny portions, overpriced,  overspiced, oh and you get to squeeze past the junk food section once again before you get out.\nNice touch.\nI forgot to mention that per other reviews this restaurant adds 4% to the bill to support living wage\nbut they don't inform you about it .\nLove it when they \" stick it to you\" !!",

Great spot for morning coffee and breakfast sando or pastry (all baked in house). I've picked up salad to go for lunch and have also had dinner twice. Loved the bread with dipping sauce, pasta with vodka sauce (a little spicy) and the meatballs. They had a house wine that's organic and a great price by the glass and bottle. Can't wait for all the sunny San Diego days to enjoy a glass of wine on the patio.",

The ambiance of the restaurant is beautiful, the service was excellent, and the food... MY GOSH THE FOOD! I recently traveled to Italy and have been searching for a comparable pasta carbonara. Cardellino has it! Every plate we had was delicious- from the starters (bread selection, Caesar salad, and burrata), to the main courses (carbonara, bolognese, meaty pizza, CARAMELIZED ONION PIZZA WITH PROSCIUTTO AND PEARS OMG), to the desserts (ricotta cheesecake and tiramisu)... could it get any better? Oh wait... YES.\n\nTwo words: Limoncello Slushy.\n\nDo yourselves a favor and go to Cardellino. You will not be disappointed!",

                  "review": "We were excited to try this new restaurant.  Had a reservation and got seated on time, even though it was crowded.  We were served water right away and were given menus.  It took about 10 minutes for our server, Juan, to take our drink order.  No one explained to us, but it's good to know...they sell wine at \"retail\" prices, so your wine is charged at their retail price plus $10 corkage.  Their wines are fairly pricy, so you might be better off bringing your own bottle and paying the $10 corkage.  We ordered a bottle of their pinot grigio.  Juan brought glasses right away.  It was another 10 minutes before he brought our wine.  I don't think it was Juan's fault.  He was personable and very service oriented.  I think they are understaffed.  We enjoyed our wine for about 20+ minutes before they brought our order, just a pasta and a pizza.  It seems like the kitchen is understaffed and can't keep pace with a full house.  I ordered a pepperoni pizza, my test for an Italian restaurant.  The crust was tough and the flavor was meh!  I can name at least 10 better pizzas in San Diego, including from chains.  My husband got the pasta with clams.  He said it was \"interesting\" but unlike any he has ever had.  The worst thing was that when we got the check, they added a 4% surcharge,\"to insure competitive compensation including medical benefits for our valued full time employees.\"  They called it Living Wages 4% on the bill.  \n\nThis is a new restaurant.  Can't they just set their prices accordingly and not add this fake charge?  It's insulting!  And by the way, we did leave a $13 tip for Juan, for just 2 entrees and the wine, so if he gets that from 10 other tables, he's getting more than a living wage.  Cardellino needs to raise their prices to cover health benefits and other expenses, and not fool customers.  We won't be going back.",

                  "review": "we are regulars at Trust, have been to Fort Oak several times, once to Rare Society and love each and every one of these restaurants.  Tonight we dined at Cardellino for the first time and the overall impression was good - not great and not bad but good.  The concept is very different from their other restaurant as is the food (in some ways).  We ordered our two drinks and minutes later two appetizers and oddly enough, the first appetizer came out before we had received our drinks.  I enjoyed the Red Moon cocktail a lot, yum!  The amazingly creamy Polenta (think Cucina Urbana) with a mushroom rag\u00f9 was hand down the most delicious dish we had tonight.  The dish was delivered without a serving spoon and we had to ask for one, the same happened with our second appetizer, the Hamachi Crudo, again no serving spoon.  One of our favorite dishes at Trust is their Hamachi Tartare and even though we expected a very different dish here, the Crudo at Cardellino was wayyy too acidy and was lacking salt. The entrees we shared were the Gamberetti Pizza (very good, not a brick oven pizza but very good) and the chopped salad with a great dressing which was delicious as well. For dessert we split the budino with biscotti and we felt it was as delicious as the budino at Cucina Urbana. Our overall impression was that everybody was very welcoming and friendly, they didn't rush us to order,eat and hand us the check which we really appreciate because it's so prevalent in most restaurants these days. They have to iron out some smaller inconsistencies which always takes time and is to be expected in a new restaurant.\n\nI just hope that diners can look past the concept here where you enter into a bakery with a deli case and the tiny hostess desk stands right in front of it.  And the menu resembles the interior -you get a bit of everything, from sophisticated appetizers to the entrees that are mostly pizze and pasta. We wish them luck and will return in a couple weeks!",

Asked for everything to come out together except for the dessert and it more or less did.  It was ALL delicious and MORE than enough for us to share!  I see Yelp is showing negative reviews but our experience was anything but -- and great service; I had a reservation for 6.30 so that may have helped.  Everyone around us looked like they were having a good time too.  Only issue is its a little pricey so looking forward to a Happy Hour there.",

We started with the fried calamari and steamed mussels. The calamari was served with a little frise salad, and was perfectly battered and crispy. The mussels were huge and broth extremely flavorful- so much so that we needed extra grilled bread for dipping up all that goodness. By the time the entrees came we were full but they were delicious nonetheless and made for great leftovers. The fusilli with vodka sauce had such a great flavor to it- I was pleasantly surprised. My guest was concerned about the mention of Calabrian chilis but in the end they weren't an issue of heat whatsoever. The pizza we got was pear, carmalized onion, proscuitto and arugula- boy oh boy. I cannot wait to go back! Please check these guys out- although I had no doubts of Chef Brad's always excellent cuisine!",

The restaurant was very busy when we went Friday evening and got a spot at the bar, which has others mentioned is now half the size.  But, was glad to get a seat. Service though very friendly needs work, got our first course and no utensils, asked for utensils, and assumed we'd get a napkin at same time. Nope, had to ask for this as well.  Caesar salad was tasty and enough for 2 to share. Caprese salad needs work, needs more basil, more flavor. Polenta while flavor was great was served lukewarm. Hamachi crudo on point. Pizza very good. Would go again and see if things improve.",

Not the place for people looking for 100 maki variations.\n\nFor a really good value, try their donburi and their salmon skin roll.",

I ate the the shrimp tempura roll and it was great! I don't normally eat sushi but now I know where to go if I crave good, quality sushi. We each ordered their sesame chicken plates and the chicken was basically made to perfection. The plates are served with white rice, salad, bean sprouts, and miso soup. All were solid side dishes.\n\nThe service was also really great! Our waitress was super sweet and very accommodating to our requests.\n\nOne tiny gripe with this place would be their hours. Online sites show that they are open until 9 pm on weekdays, but they actually close at 8 pm. It appears that they are open for a very short amount of time.",

But i believe they were the first Japanese restaurant in San Diego, I think i remember reading that somewhere many years ago.\n\nThe family who runs it is very nice and polite, since my last review many years ago, they have expanded to have a small sushi bar as well.\n\nMy favorite thing to get here is the sesame chicken, its fried and has some sauce on it which is so good.  There are also different combos that you can get that either come with a 6 piece California roll, tempura or sashimi.  I usually get a combo with either tempura or sashimi.  Each meal comes with bean spouts and salad, the sprouts are bland and the salad just comes with a vinegar bases dressing which i think is blah.\n\nToday I ordered the #1 combination, Sesame Chicken with tempura ($15) pretty amazing that they have not changed their prices in so many years.  The Chicken was as amazing and tasty as i remember it, the tempura was light and crisp and the dipping sauce was delicious too.  I recommend you put some rice aside in a bowl and put the tempura on top and pour half the sauce over it so that the sauce drips on to the rice, then use the other half for dipping.  They do not give soup with take out orders so the usual miso soup that comes with the meal is omitted, which i was fine with.\n\nI also ordred a negi-hama (green onion and hamachi) hand roll, which was delicious!  I liked the texture of the nori and fatty freshness of the Hamachi.  I liked that their sushi is pretty inexpensive and of good quality.  Its not high end $100 sushi but you definitely get more than what you pay for.\n\nI can't believe I forgot about this place for so long!  I was glad to revisit them and to give them my business and to reconnect with them.  I talked to them about when they'd be open for dine in service, they said they aren't sure yet.  I'll be back again soon, probably for sushi or sesame chicken or both!\nStill open\nNew hours during pandemic era. Take out only\nUseful 8\nFunny 3\nCool 8\n6/4/2009Previous review\nBeen coming here for years.  It's so strange to find a good Japanese restaurant so far away from Convoy street.  But here it is!  and what a treat.  I almost always get the sesame chicken, it's the best thing on the menu!  That alone is enough to fill me up but i always end up getting a combo cause every thing is so good.  Some of my favorites are the sesame chicken and sashimi or sesame chicken and tempura, or sashimi and tempura.  \n\nThe service is super friendly, I get the feeling its a family owned restaurant, they definitely make you feel at home.  They have recently remodeled to include a sushi bar, its not the best (high end sushi) but definitely better than the majority of what's available in San Diego (as far as nigiri goes).  \n\nPros: Sesame chicken is the best, Great service\nCons: Sides on the combos are not the best. (salad with basic vinegar dressing)  Wish it came with some tsukemono.",

My friend and I weren't feeling sushi so we order one Teriyaki Chicken dinner and one Beef Teriyaki Combo (bento). The only difference between the dinner and the combo/bento is that you don't get the extra item that can be California Rolls or Tempura etc. You still get Soup, Salad and Bean Sprouts. The Soup was yummy but the salad and bean sprouts were not. The bean sprouts are in a mayo-like dressing which gives some flavor but I didn't enjoy it. The iceberg lettuce in the salad was so cold it had ice chips on it.  Unfortunately, the main entrees were equally disappointing. The only positives regarding the food was that the Teriyaki Sauce wasn't supper thick or sweet, which I liked and the chicken was a very large portion. The cost was on the higher side considering the quality of the food received.\n\nService was good. Our server was SO sweet and checked on us frequently without being invasive to our conversation. She refilled our drinks before we would even need to ask and was always smiling.\n\nAmbiance of the restaurant is super chill. It's pretty quiet inside with plenty of seating. My friend and I lost track of time and realized that they had already closed! They were so kind as to leave us be since they were still cleaning up and shutting down for the night.\n\nLocation is very convenient, right off the 5 freeway. They have there own parking lot which is really great considering how busy the area is and how hard parking can get.\n\nThe food is most important and was lacking - so I can't give more than 3 stars. Why they aren't getting less than 3 stars from me is because they were very pleasant, it was super chill/comfortable inside and very convenient to get in and out of. With all that considered, there is just too much great food in this area for me to come back.\nChicken Teriyaki plate\nBeef combo/bento",

It's family-owned and while it looks unassuming on the outside, they put a lot of care into their restaurant. I definitely love getting their lunch specials, the chicken tempura (sesame style) is AMAZING. The lunch specials and combos are also sooo cheap. Like under $10 for a delicious and hearty Japanese meal.\n\nI'll put it this way: when I came home from a 7 month deployment and my parents asked what I wanted to eat, I took them to Yoshino. I hope COVID hasn't impacted them too hard, they have been offering takeout and I will keep supporting them!",

I can visit this place on the daily for authentic, fresh caught sushi, rolls and even cooked dishes.\nI enjoyed the Spicy Tuna, Spicy Albacore and Unagi! All were tasty.\nUnagi is the barometer for sushi quality. If done well, it's the best cut on most menus. If done poorly, you can estimate the other dish quality.\nThis unagi is soft, not chewy, savory, baked right and on par with only a few.\nMy first try will not be my last try!\nSee all photos from Andrew B. for Yoshino Japanese Restaurant",

It's located in the ghetto ass building behind Lucha Libre so don't be alarmed haha.\n\nThis place is pricey, but it's worth it. The fish is super freshy and they deliver huge portions. The chirashi bowl was on point, but not the best I've had...still worth it though. We also had some pot stickers, which were good, nothing special. Lastly, the Yaki Chicken and Sashimi box was legit. It came with 8 thick slices of sashimi. Dank. It was pricey, but it came with miso soup, salad, and a nice helping of rice. I actually left super full!\n\nOur total dinner cost about $55 pre tip. That's worth it to me, if it's good, and it was so I was satisfied. Oh and I think there was a large Sapporo in there!\n\nCheck it out!",

Located in the ghetto looking parking lot next to Lucha Libre, doesn't get crowded much. I can see why (because it's pretty pricey compared to Sushi Deli or RK Sushi down the street)\n\nI was very surprised to see that the bento boxes cost nearly $15-$20. I was at first reluctant to even order, but I thought I treat myself. I got the chicken teriyaki bento box with sashimi. They sure do give you a lot of chicken, and to my amazement, they give you a lot of sashimi pieces too! You get 8 thick slices of sashimi (well they better right, for the price?!). Every piece of the sashimi (tuna and hamachi?) was delicious. It was very fresh. No fishy tasting. I sat alone at the bar and saw how hard the chef (probably owner) worked to cut his fish and make the sushi. I appreciate hard working people.\n\nYou will definitely have leftovers for the next day. I will come here next time to try their udon!\nSee all photos from Lisa W. for Yoshino Japanese Restaurant",

The Decour is exactly what you would find in Japan and because the staff is mostly Japanese you can imagine that you are in Japan because it is so similar and the staff makes you feel like you're in Japan. The lunch special is fantastic with a great selection nigiri and a California roll. The octopus handroll I had was one of the best I've had and tasted even better than the one that I had in Japan. The staff is so sweet and efficient and caring.\nSee all photos from Avelino C. for Yoshino Japanese Restaurant",

You have less chance to be \"forgotten\" because multiple servers take care of customer here. A point worthy of special mention is the price. Compared to other Japanese restaurants, this place offers much affordable price and still serve great foods. Especially I like Katsudon, and I heard a rumor that the chef cooks eggs differently for different country people by considering their preference. If you are okay, try \"soft-boiled\" katsudon here, it's definitely the best katsudon in San Diego.",

Stopped by for dinner on a Saturday at their opening at 5PM, the restaurant was filled by 5:30 and a small crowd was waiting by the time we left at 6.  Driving in, I thought the exterior appearance was a little sketchy but the interior felt warm and appeared very clean and orderly.  \n\nAs for the food, it was all good.  The hamachi kama was probably the our favorite. The collar was cooked and seasoned just right and it was a hefty piece as well.  The Nabeyaki udon was simple, just an egg, one shrimp tempura and a few pieces of fish cake.  The chicken teriyaki was white meat and not too overly cooked.  The meat was drenched in a rather heavy teriyaki sauce.  I would ask for the sauce on the side next time.  The sashimi that accompanied the chicken teriyaki was 6 medium slices of salmon and ahi.  \n\nThe chirashi bowl has been my staple ever since I experienced the one at Akasaka.  Of course, this one didn't measure up.  None of them do.  But at less than half the cost, what would I expect.  The chiraishi bowl was adorned with 10 or so small to medium slices of sashimi, along with a couple of thin slices of tamago.  As a dinner, it's not going to be terribly filling but should suffice for those with dainty appetite.  \n\nThe service was very good also.  Our waitress took our order and the table of 8 next of us without jotting anything down.  Our order was perfect and I didn't hear the next table complain either.  Impressive.\n\nOverall a nice experience even though there were no standouts.",

I hate to give a two star but I felt I have to save people the disappointment if you have never been.  However, I can only judge based on what I had.  So here it is, we ordered:\n\n1. Miso soup\n2. Soft shell crab\n3. Fried calamari\n4. Salmon nigiri\n\nThe miso soup came with a metal spoon. Not something I'm used to. Made it difficult to enjoy hot soup, bc the spoon would burn my tongue.\n\nThe soft shell crab was mostly bread batter. If you know what delicious soft shell crab taste like, I don't need to say much. The picture says it all.\n\nThe fried calamari, well again very disappointed.  Maybe it was the end of the night but it was on the over-greasy side.  \n\nThe place is questionable looking, but I don't judge a book by its cover, unless it's the bathroom.  I don't get a feeling of cleanliness I expect from a sushi restaurant bathroom.\nFried calamari\nSoft shell crab. Batter overload",

I think there is something for everyone on the menu if you like sushi or even if you don't! The staff are very kind and good service.\n\nI think they have a smaller selection of specialty rolls than I'd like because I am looking for more options with raw fish. But there were more with smoked salmon or eel or shrimp tempura.",

Good thing we found this place, ambiance is calm, clean and inviting. Their Chicken and Salmon teriyaki is sumptuous. They even have Salmon Kama, not in the menu but you can ask they have it, seaweed salad is great too, also their Udon soup was really good. They also have delicious mochi ice cream. If you like chicken/beef teriyakis, seafood, sushi and Japanese food this is the place to be. They have other food choices in their menu and I'm sure its also good.

The entrees come with salad, rice and miso soup. The soup was nice but I didn't know the gyoza came in a broth. The dumplings were ok, a little too soft from the broth, not the best I've had but alright. The teriyaki chicken was freshly grilled and tasty.\n\nFor me, the sesame chicken was the star of the evening. Deliciously crisp and juicy in a tasty sauce. Both entrees came with crispy bean sprouts in some sort of creamy sauce that reminded me of Japanese mayo and a salad of lettuce and carrots. The sprouts were a wonderful addition\nI highly recommend the sesame chicken!",

I wasn't really feeling like sushi the night we visited so I went with the sesame chicken bento. The chicken was awesome and there was way too much food for me. We packed it in for lunch the next day.\n\nMy husband had the tempura chicken and HOLY CHICK-EN that's a lot of chicken! He has the appetite of a thousand hungry warriors and even he couldn't finish the whole plate. Granted he was also eating a spicy tuna roll, but you get the idea.\n\nGreat place. We love this little neighborhood for food in general. Everything we've had in this vicinity has been excellent.",

Again, an old building, but kept clean.\nAttentive service, A+.\nFood is brought out promptly after orders placed. Within 10 minutes for the rolls, just a few minutes later for the main courses.\nWe stopped in for lunch.\nPrices are what one would expect for a Japanese restaurant. The meal for the 2 of us with sodas for beverage was $40.\nThe food was not great.\nWe ordered the teriyaki chicken combo, the katsu don (Pork) & rainbow roll.\nThe chicken was tender, the sauce was flavorful. The salad was a hunk of lettuce drowning in dressing. The rice was a bit hard. The pork was tough. The inions in the katsu don were yummy. The seaweed wrapper in the rolls was very tough, unpleasantly chewy. The fish on the rolls actually had that unpleasant fishy taste. It did not seem super fresh. The tastes on everything seemed to be lacking. We won't be back. There are far too many exceptional Japanese Sushi restaurants in San Diego to settle for mediocre.",

I was so craving some. I did settle on the saba (broiled mackeral) entree while hubby got the salmon equivalent. Lil guy forego the child's menu and ordered the nabeyaki udon.\n\nThe miso soup was spot on! My saba was also perfectly broiled with the fish very moist and flavorful. Hubby's salmon he said was good too. I took his word on it as I'm not a huge salmon fan. The accompanying salad and bean sprout salad both had delicious dressings: one was a sesame dressing and the other a vinagreite. Portions were smaller than expected but was about right for a real Japanese portion.\n\nHubby and I also shared the tofu salad which was just awesome. The dressing tasted like a mix of ponzu with a touch of sesame. The tofu salad came with lettuce, wakame, julienned cucumbers and carrots.\n\nThe nabeyaki udon had 2 pieces of tempura: one shrimp and one carrot, some kamaboku, chicken, mushroom and a poached egg. The broth was a little sweet, but otherwise, good. The udon was a bit doughy probably because it was the frozen kind. Lil guy liked it though.\n\nIt was definitely better than expected because we didn't expect the food to be all that authentic considering the clientele. But it was pretty good. Service was also above average.\n\nUnfortunately, the lighting was bad so my photos turned out too yellow!\nSee all photos from Anita L. for Yoshino Japanese Restaurant",

We had originally planned on going to a different restaurant close by but it was closed that day and found this place instead on Yelp. The parking here can probably be a pain, but we all luckily got there when other cars were leaving.\n\nFor udon they have 2 choices: tempura and nabeyaki. The nabeyaki had an egg, a few pieces of tempura, chicken and some other things in it. I'm no expert when it comes to udon having only had it one other time in an actual restaurant, but this one tasted good. My friend's bowl didn't come with an egg, but when we brought it up, they brought her one right out. The tempura udon comes with shrimp and some veggies and it looked good as well though I didn't try it.\n\nOur server was friendly and we didn't have to wait too long for our food.\nNabeyaki udon",

I order the Chirashi, basically sashimi on top of a bed of rice. For the price of $18.95 I expected higher quality fish - there was two pieces of eggs, two imitation crab pieces, one shrimp and four mixed fishes. There were slices of cucumbers with a tiny bit of roe. The service was good and the quick. But for the price and mediocre food, I would not go back.",

I had the same soup and some spicy tuna rolls. They raved about their food!! They both said and (my husband lived in Japan for a couple of years while in the military many moons ago) that it was the best sushi they've ever had. They both talked about the temperature of their fish and how perfect it was too eat!! The soup was also tasty and their tempura veggies were generous and not soggy inside. I actually ate my broccoli!! The sushi came out before the soup which I had wanted the reverse, but Maybe thats just the way they serve it? All in all...delicious! And the food is what matters most!",

We received a warm greeting and grabbed some open seats at the sushi bar.\n\nOn this visit, I had the Seafood Sunomono and their Special Inari. The components in the salad were fresh and delectable, from the neta to the veggies, all meticulously arranged atop a plate of light vinegar dressing [yelp.com/biz_photos/79zH\u2026. I appreciate the simplicity and sweetness of inari, so I was curious to try the Yoshino Special version. At first glance it looks like the typical tofu pocket of rice, but there's more: Spicy crab, avocado, and egg [yelp.com/biz_photos/79zH\u2026. The additional ingredients add an element of creaminess, with a hint of mildly spiciness, and I enjoyed this dish. My friend had a spicy tuna roll and a Philadelphia roll [yelp.com/biz_photos/79zH\u2026. I didn't sample and my friend said that both rolls were good.\n\nAs the dinner rush slowed down, we had an opportunity to chat more with Yama and learned that his family restaurant been open for over 20 years (I think 22, but let me know if I need to *edit) and that they originally had the spot where Lucha Libre is now. I'm not going to rant on the parking lot issue or popular taco shop that has become a local phenomenon after the tv publicity because I've enjoyed their food too. It is what it is.\n\nThe ambiance is relaxed, and the absence of blaring music, raised voices, or distracting tv screens has a calming effect. With their customer service, I generally felt like an honored guest in a traditional Japanese home and my first experience here last night was a pleasant one. If you're looking for a chill time minus the pretentious hype, then stop by to visit Yama and his family at Yoshino.",

Many places tend to decline with age, and I have no idea what the original establishment looked like... but it appears to have aged like a fine wine.\n\nStopped at this place on a whim before getting on a plane as India St. is conveniently proximal to the airport, and I didn't feel like waiting in line at Bali Hai.  Like many SoCal eating establishments it is located in a strip mall and does not bespeak luxury.  A gentleman in a security jacket kindly maintains the few parking spots outside for the diners within.\n\nFirst regret: should've ordered more sushi.  Wasn't in the mood before getting on a long flight but did get the spicy tuna roll.  The thing that fresh sushi has is a lack of fish odor.  Check.  Good sushi isn't soggy or sopping with dressing.  Double check.  In fact this tuna roll had a heavenly aroma of sesame without derailing the spiciness or the tuna-ness.  And the rice should melt in your mouth.  Triple check.  Awesome.\n\nOrdered the tonkatsu and was extremely satisfied by the golden crispiness, that amazingly stayed warm even though I took forever to eat it (trying to savor every bite).  The tempura udon was similarly delicious and piping hot - the tempura served on a separate dish so it doesn't get soggy (so many places fail to abide by this standard).\n\nThe service was extraordinarily friendly and quick and I will definitely be going back, next time getting (a) more sushi (b) probably a little drunk and (c) not on a plane after I eat.\n\nOne thing that would make it better?  Uh... karaoke??  Yes, please.",

A few weeks later we came again and the staff remember us and gave us his tie back. The service is outstanding. They always remember me and are very friendly. I love coming here. Sure is a diamond in the ruff. Go here and you won't be disappointed.",

They always have the same 2 sushi chefs who are amazing. The quality of the sashimi is on point and the prices are decent. We've tried the other favorite San Diego sushi spots but this is the one we prefer. Order the salad with the creamy dressing. It's amazing, we call it \"crack salad\"",

The portions they serve always seem to be more than ample, and the food is always very fresh. I also have had their sushi and a few other things on the menu - all have been great! I have NEVER had a bad experience here in over 20 years. The owners are very friendly and always greet customers with an enthusiastic \"hello\" as they enter the restaurant. Very friendly! The only drawback is that their parking lot is very small and fills up quickly on busy nights. However, they do keep an on-site security guard to monitor the parking situation and to make sure that parking spaces are not being taken by people who are not patronizing the businesses on the property. I think in over 20 years I have only been unable to find a parking space a few times total and had to leave. Highly recommended!",

There were a number of people there who looked like regulars. The service was terrific and the sushi was fresh.

I'm extremely particular about my sushi and their sushi is always incredibly fresh and delicious.  Not to mention, the sushi is very reasonably priced.\n\nWe not only love going there for the food, but also because the owners, Kat and Yama, are like family.  They are the sweetest, most loving people.  If, like us, you have kids, it's the perfect place to go - very family friendly and you always feel welcome.  It's like the 'Cheers' of the sushi world.  :)\n\nDon't let the non-assuming exterior of Yoshino's fool you - you'll discover a gem inside and the sushi can't be beat!",

You just never know.\n\nBut Yoshino has a spicy albacore roll for like $4 that is so delicious, if you put that sauce on my elbow, I'd make it a snack.  And they have some bean sprout side-dish thing that is out of this world.  It's like bean sprouts with some kind of paprika mayo pickled something or other action on it.    It doesn't matter what it is... it could be baby tears and I'd order it, it's that good.\n\nThe other goodness is that it's a stone's throw from my place (ok, a few blocks) so it's fast and they're always so nice there.\n\nSometimes it's a toss up on when they're open... that's my only rub.  Sometimes I go for lunch and they've just closed or are going to close. I haven't quite figured that timing out yet, but I'll update when I do.  :P",

I've only tried a few of their standard rolls thus far (shrimp tempura, spicy salmon), but those are delicious too. I'd definitely recommend it.",

                  "review": "Updated review\nWent here last night with the fiance to satisfy a sushi craving.\n\nEric had the sashimi combo, and enjoyed it, but said that he probably would have preferred the sushi combo, which is what I had.  We also had the steamed gyoza, which was so tender that it was hard to pick up with chopsticks without it breaking or slipping off.  Regardless, it was very tasty.  As was the edamame; but then again, that's what...soybeans and salt?\n\nThe spicy tuna roll wasn't terribly spicy, but was still good.  The eel roll, however, is to die for!  Highly recommend.\n\nService was extremely quick.  Last time (see my previous review) really must have been an isolated incident.  Within 5-7 minutes of ordering, our table was covered in food.  And it didn't take forever and a day to get the check taken care of.\n\nLove, love Yoshino's.\nUseful 2\nFunny\nCool 2\n6/16/2009Previous review\nCame by here tonight after working out with two friends of mine.  This seems to be a trend - we work out, then we eat.  At least with sushi, I don't necessarily have to feel guilty about it.\n\nThis place reminds me of the first place that I ever ate sushi.  Years ago, in a little hole-in-the-wall neighborhood joint in Berkeley Heights, NJ.  An ex introduced me to sushi.  I still love the sushi - the ex, not so much.\n\nYoshino is a no-frills place.  Which I love.  Every once in a while, fancy rolls and decor is nice.  But usually, I just want some fish on some rice, miso soup and salad.  Yoshino delivers.\n\nThe edamame was good, as was this bean sprout concoction that my friends ordered.  My tofu salad was really good.  A basic salad with ginger dressing, with slices of tofu (plain, not fried) on top sprinkled with sesame seeds (This was about $6).  The miso soup was very salty, and not enough tofu for my taste - however, it was still a good soup.  \n\nI got the Sushi Combination - this included a California roll and 6 varied pieces of sushi.  Very fresh and delicious.  $15.95 and it included the soup. I was completely full and satisfied after the salad and this combo.  However, I could have probably eaten a ton more, because I seem to be a bottomless pit where sushi is concerned.",

                  "review": "I live within walking distance to Yoshino and had been meaning to try it out for months, and I finally went with my boyfriend the other day. There were certain things I really liked about my experience and other things that were somewhat on the... underwhelming side.\n\nI liked Yoshino because it was clean, simple, comfortable and the service was very friendly and on top of things. I also really enjoyed the sashimi mix platter, with the exception of the \"krab\". I think featuring imitation crab on what is supposedly a sashimi platter is a huge mistake. Other than that, I was pleased with both the cuts and the freshness of the fish. I also ordered the sunomono salad, miso soup, the salmon nigiri and the caterpillar roll. Everything was ok, but I didn't care for the caterpillar roll. I felt like the tamago (egg) shouldn't have been part of this roll. Also, caterpillar rolls usually have a lot more unagi.\n\nMy boyfriend ordered the chicken katsu donburi. He seemed to like it, but to me it seemed like the katsu was incredibly soggy and it tasted like it had been microwaved.\n\nYoshino is right by my house and has good sashimi for a very reasonable price. I will probably come back when I have cravings for Japanese food, but I am definitely going to continue my search for great sushi in San Diego. Right now Sushi Ota is the one to beat!",

The food is consistently good, the prices are reasonable, the fish is fresh, and everyone there treats me like family (everyone knows me by name, and are genuinely interested to hear what I've been up to since my last visit).

The servers were courteous and filled drinks promptly.  The menu was basic: Sushi nigiri was about $4/2pcs, standard rolls about $6, and other Japanese fare.\n\nEach time I've been, I ordered a different combo (A-D Comb) between $6-9 with choice of chicken teriyaki, chicken sesame, or beef teriyaki as the main course along with small salad, California roll, sticky rice, and miso soup.  Nothing was spectacular.  The miso soup, yes it did come with a silver spoon.  One co-worker says it tastes like dirty dishwater.  I didn't share that sentiment.  The roll was good, better than the chicken I ate.  Next time I come here, I'll try some actual raw sushi, because the fish in the counter window did look fresh.  \n\nFor now, three stars.",

The eel was over cooked, Seemed like I got the \"bottom of the pot\" rice, it was mostly hard.\n\nThe saving grace was the yama roll, it was delicious, I will come back here and just order their special rolls and try their sushi/sashimi.\n\nI also like places that give you an orange slice at the end of the meal, it was very well presented here. That was pretty nice.\n\nOnly complaint I have about the service is that they didn't refill our drinks when our glasses were empty. We had to ask for refills, it wasn't just us either, I noticed a few other patrons doing the same.\n\nThe short of the long, come here, order rolls or sushi but stay away from the main entrees.",

Until the restaurant you were planning on going to is closed & you look on yelp for another good option nearby (for example). The outside does give the impression it could be a front for something unsavory, but the inside is cozy, inviting, & unassuming. The people are friendly, and all the food I've tried there has been delicious, fresh, & reasonably priced. I especially recommend the Atlantic roll. YUM! Extra added bonus: come to find out it's the oldest sushi restaurant in San Diego (open since the 70s)... interesting factoid of San Diego history!",

Yummy sashimi and rolls, great presentation, and very welcoming staff.\n\nPlus they put up with our large, loud group and brought the food out at a nice pace.\n\nGreat place to start the night if you're going out in the area of Mission Hills, The Casbah, etc.",

You're not going to feel like you're in a fancy sushi place, but the thing about this place is it's high-quality and authentic...  not overpriced. They don't have a million fancy rolls.. but they focus on quality over quantity. And ... To be extravagant- get the mushroom tempura spicy crab appetizer- it'll change your life... At least while you're chewing ... And maybe a few minutes after that. Time well spent",

So we yelped and found Yoshino. Its a little tiny sushi place in the corner of a little strip mall.\n\nDon't get here early, because they don't let you in. They open at 6, and don't turn the light on till than. Once they opened we were the first ones in the restaurant and the waitress sat us in the BACK corner. The service SUCKED big time. We had to keep going up to the front to get the waitress about 5 different times for different things. Although the place was empty.\n\nThey are accommodating in making special rolls but they are a bit pricey. I enjoyed the American roll...Although the pieces were so LARGE I didn't think I could fit it into my mouth. A plate would have been nice also, so that it didn't seem we were eating off the table.\n\nOverall not the best experience, I think I'll try Sushi Deli next time I'm in the Mission Hills Area.",

I was shocked that i received my miso with a spoon. Spicy tuna roll was not as spicy as I usually get and the soy sauce was a little too salty, I noticed it wasn't Kikkoman brand. The man who made the sushi was awesome, he gave us a couple of orange slice, but these were anything but ordinary. He sliced off the rind except for a little piece on the corner that was to be used as a handle. Ingenious! Total bill came to $23 for 2, FOR A SNACK?!\n\nParking lot right in front. I heard Bar Dynamite in the same complex plays some good hip hop tunes, but in the 10X we passed this complex up, it was nonexistent to me and only existed by a sign that said it was there. holler.",

We were helped just as soon as we sat down and the food came quickly, which is helpful when you're hungry.  My only criticism is that it's not the best sushi place. You're better off ordering the other Japanese dishes, such as the udon or chicken something. The quality of the fish just wasn't the best.  So if you'd ask me if I'd be back, I'd likely say yes, but I wouldn't go out of my way.",

I took most of the chicken and the rest of the white rice home which was a good snack later.\n This place is great with great prices.  The only thing I don't like about Yoshino is the parking.

Their menu's changed a bit over the years, becoming more streamlined and easier to understand, but the food has stayed consistently delicious. I usually go for the saba and uni nigiri to polish off the seafood udon.\n\nBest of all, they're right across the street from Gelato Vero, though you'll have to move your car out of their lot if you decide to take advantage of this.

Ordered a couple of sushi rolls, and I don't know why, but they all were so salty, spicy tuna one was uneatable at all!! Had to send 2 out of 3 rolls back. We also had beef teriyaki, that was pretty decent. Overall quality of the food was just ok, definitely did not meet their on the higher side prices. Will not go back there again.",

Was not amazed that the guys behind the sushi bar remembered me, even with my crazy goat boy bread. I went in there knowing it will be just as awesome as it was, since that last time I ate here all those years before.\n\nI brought my brother and mother with me this time. I did act like a hog who had not been feed in a few weeks. Had numerous rolls, my brother had a combo plate, mom had a combo plate too. They also had a few rolls also. Everything was perfect as always. Besides the fact that the food and service is always top notch, the best thing about coming here in San Diego is the price.\n\nWe left there satisfied, full, and did not have to take out a third mortgage to pay for it. Total bill $54.00 dollars, for three starving adults, you can not beat the price or quality of food anywhere else in San Diego. I recommend everything!!!!!",

And the tuna wasn't as fresh as I would have liked.  I think they tried to combat that by making it spicy.  That said, the other entrees my party had were great.  And price wise not terrible at all.  The three star subtitle says it best.  A-OK.\n\nWhat I will say this place has, is a very family owned vibe.  There are pictures in the background of their fishing adventures.  There are personal items on the well that you can peek at.  It's a nice change considering most sushi places nowadays try to be as modern as possible. It has a nice down home cooking vibe to it.",

Miso soup is okay , not my favorite. Sesame chicken was good as well as teriyaki. Didn't have any sushi because the menu lacked descriptions and was it was difficult to order sushi if you haven't been a regular there. Plus reviews said it wasn't really a place for the sushi. I did enjoy my sprout salad though, it was interesting and the dressing was delicious. Service was okay, waitress forgot to put dressing for chicken on the side and then when we needed her she was no where to be found for 10 minutes we had to go up to the sushi bar for some extra rice. We must have come at a crazy time because two tables had a ton of screaming kids so it annoyed our dinner a bit. But overall the place was okay and we mayyyyy come back but it's unlikely.",

                  "review": "AH TEMPURA!\n\nI grew up in San Diego and learned at an early age to absolutely LOVE tempura.  Ooh, the sweet tsuyu!  How nice, the fluffy rice!  And the hearty crunch of tempura batter (provided they're made properly) is just to-die-for!  The most common, of course, is shrimp tempura with vegetables, but a lot of Japanese restaurants will also sell just the shrimp and/or just the vegetables, a la carte or combined with rice.  Whee, the excellent ebi!\n\nOne of the small blessings of the tiny little town where I taught English in Japan was that it was right on Himi Bay where some of the best shrimpers are based; they harvest the most delicious shrimp right out of the Japan Sea and I loved to eat tempura in Takaoka so much that I truly made myself sick:  A bad sample of shrimp gave me colitis and has left me with an allergy to shrimp.  I love it but it kills me - literally - to eat it!  It really breaks my heart to be unable to eat shrimp any more.  \n\nThe second half of my year in Japan was sadly without my weekly restaurant-roving tempura-testing explorations of Takaoka and its surrounding towns.  That was probably good, because I was gaining weight pretty rapidly on the deep-fried stuff [Hey, I never even dreamed it was healthy, I just knew it was delicious] and only stopped expanding when the colitis made me lose 25 pounds in a week (NOT a recommended diet, even if you're masochistic enough to like that kind of pain in your guts).\n\nBut when I came back to The States and was visiting my sister at a company on San Diego Avenue, she took me to dinner at this little tough-to-find place on Washington Street.  I'm glad we walked there because, if you don't know where it is, it's easy to fly right on by if you're driving down the hill.  Yoshino's is almost-but-not-quite at the bottom of Washington Street on the down-hill (north) side.\n\nAnd there at Yoshinos I found my saving grace:  Chicken Tempura.\n\nNobody else makes this, guys.  That's astounding because the idea is so amazingly simple - it's fried chicken, Portu/Japanese-style (hot oil cooking having been introduced to the Japanese by Portuguese sailors, then made into a very Japanese artifact of its own) served with rice, tsuyu, and similarly battered-and-fried vegetables.\n\nYears later, when a girlfriend from out of town came to visit, we shacked up for the weekend at a hotel near the airport and we ate at Yoshino's.  She raved about the sushi - so much better than she could get in Colorado, but not as good as she remembered in Hawaii - and I delighted in the Chicken Tempura again and again and...  \n\nLast weekend, while visiting my old friends in San Diego, I made a point of stopping by Yoshino's just after I got into town.  That's right!  I drove over 150 miles through Los Angeles and one of my highlights was the chance to eat Tempura Chicken at Yoshino's.  Was it worth it?  Every single bite!\n\nLong ago, I decided that, since I can't take the ambience with me, I prefer to get great food for my money and worry less about the ambience. Yoshino's gives me that every time I visit.  The food is great and the prices are very reasonable.  The reality is that Yoshino's is in a rather-run-down part of town in a kind-of-run-down building with a somewhat run-down interior.  I've paid higher prices for worse food in better looking restaurants; I go to Yoshino's for the good food and that's what they deliver.\n\nI had better in Japan, but that's a tough trip to make for the joy of tempura.  Instead, EVERY time I go to San Diego, I'm hitting Yoshino's at least once -- unless they want to share their recipe....",

The food even though a bit pricey its totally worth it! Is simple delicious their teriyaki is to die for! Never go there without ordering to go.. The tempura roll, the avocado roll, the cucumber roll, the alaskan roll, their miso soup man so much food to order but those are our usual favorites! If u like pork and are not allergic like me definitely order the fried gyoza i hear is delicious! And you will never go wrong with their tempura ice cream! Vanilla or green tea they're both delicious! What else can you ask for? Amazing customer service great staff and best of all authentic japanese food!! No one bit americanized :) we love you yoshino's!!  Ps.. This place deserves nothing less than 5 star reviews!",

We intended on going to Lucha Libre next door but could only find parking in Yoshino's lot, so we changed our plans and went in and im sure glad we did. Its a small place where the staff seems to know much of the guests. We ordered two of the dinner specials, Chicken Teri and Broiled Salmon, both were great and came with Salad, rice, and Miso. The chicken was cooked perfectly the way i like it, as well as the salmon. Cant wait to head back to try more of their dishes. The only down side was no sushi specials like many sushi places have now...but I imagine it is very good still!",

The tuna had a very dark purplish color and the salmon in the Philadelphia roll was a cloudy light pink. This should have been a sign something was wrong, but I ate on piece of the Philadelphia roll and quickly decided to move onto the spicy tuna roll. This was a mistake, and I ended up spiting out the spicy tuna roll into my napkin. Both rolls appeared to have been made sometime ago, and kept in a refrigerator in the backroom. The fish was definitely not fresh, and had the taste to prove it. Overall, this is the type of restaurant I expect to see on Kitchen Nightmares, but I am not sure if Chef Ramsey can save this one!",

They have other tasteful items too like the katsu don.  The food is always consistently good.  The miso soup is hot like it should be.  I've brought many people here and each person has liked it.  Great customer service too! What more can you ask for?!  Authentic Japanese cuisine.",

I tried the chicken tempura since it was the lunch special. It was moist and freshly fried, exactly how you want tempura to be. I've never tried chicken this way but it was moist and tender and turned out great. Just realize this is a working class, Japanese, quality food shop with friendly staff. It's not a fancy sushi place serving up California roles. It's authentic: I lived in Japan for years and the best working class places to eat a daily meal are like this.  I didn't try any sushi, but I bet it's great as they ha photos of the chef fishing and respect the fish.",

When we walked past La Puerta, the host was so friendly and the vibe was chill so we stayed!\n\nOur table ordered the tacos and burritos and nachos. The Cochinita was so tasty and flavorful and they can make it gluten free. The surf and turf nachos I heard were amazing. The burrito  was huge and I heard it was delicious. And I ordered their version of a regular margarita and it was so refreshing. You can taste the fresh lime- no use of artificial stuff here.\n\nAnd they play dope music! A great place to take friends from out of town who want some good tacos and a fun vibe!\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool 1\nHailey P.\nBusiness Owner",

Well that has all changed. The second location of La Puerta located in Mission Hills is bright, airy, great outdoor seating, and the same food you have been accustomed to.\n\nWe both ended up getting the Huevos Rancheros... I am still full as I write this hours later. Had a very nice vibe, give it a try!\nHuevos Rancheros",

The design and layout of this place is pretty cool and has a nice date night feel to it. We grabbed a couple drinks, chips and guac, veggie quesadilla, and a taco platter (carnitas were delicious!). Everything came out quickly and was presented nicely. The chips and guac were surprisingly good but the quesadillas weren't particularly great and not crispy enough. All of the tacos were tasty and the sides were awesome too. Shoutout to our server Miguel who was fantastic throughout the meal. I will definitely come check out this place again and see what the rest of the menu looks like.\n\nBtw - I found out they have a pretty good happy hour menu on weekdays from 3-5. Half off all appetizers, quesadillas, and drinks I think.\nUseful 2\nFunny\nCool 2\nHailey P.\nBusiness Owner",

They also offer salsas with varying degrees of heat.\n\nI had 99 Problems, mezcal and grapefruit. I also had their house Old Fashioned that was a bit on the sweet side. So, ask your server to adjust the sweetness to your likeness.\n\nI love this location and will be back for sure!!

The alcohol portion of HH is probably the most generous and really opens up options for drinks. Service was attentive which kept the drinks flowing within HH timeframe.\n\nThe appetizers were great finger food, but all the fried tortilla between the chips and the flautitas did get overwhelming. My favorite HH items were the guacamole and the house margarita. Classics! I would avoid the fundido cheese. It came out as a chunk of cheese that had to be cut with a knife, rather than melty dippable cheese as expected.\nSee all photos from Kelly D. for La Puerta",

I tried to order a virgin frozen mango margarita but they are pre made in a slushy machine so only a version on the rocks was available.\n\nThe appetizers were the big hit of the evening.  The guacamole and chips were amazing, I'd be very confident to say its the best guac in San Diego.  The chips were very crunchy and seemed made in house.  Very highly recommended.\n\nThe Queso fundido with chorizo was also outstanding, gooey melted cheese and chorizo.  The cheese was very gooey and stretchy and definitely needed the spoon to spin it around the chips.\n\nThe chicken quesadilla was also very good, the chicken had a nice char to them and also had some flavorful (non spicy) chilis (poblanos?) in there which raised it to a new level that is not found in other places.\n\nI got a pastor burrito for dinner, it was definitely flavorful and had more of those tasty chilis but it was not the kind of pastor that comes off a rotating spit.  So it was good but didn't have that nice charred caramelized bits that come from being on a rotisserie.\n\nEveryone else ordered tacos, which seemed to be a big hit.  They were small street taco size tacos but that seems to be the way to go.\n\nThe flan was also good, it was smooth and had a good caramel flavor.\n\nParking was pretty easy i found a spot a few blocks away also the meters in the area don't need to be fed after 6pm so you can easily find a spot if needed.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Gonna add this to my list of places to take out of town guests.\n\nHighly recommend the Guacamole and chips, Queso Fundido with chorizo and chicken quesadilla\nSee all photos from Ryan M. for La Puerta",

My DRINKING DAYS are behind me....\n\nWhat a shame, I could be trying all the margaritas, mezcals, and tequilas in La Puerta since this place is close to me.  \n\nTo belatedly celebrate my birthday, we decided to check the Happy Hour (3-5) with a great deal on drinks and appetizers and quesadillas.  I got there early so I got us a table (no reservations accepted).  I started with the Bark of the Moon for a spicy start (but a little lighter on the spice).  Yes, this old mad can take spice but not SPICY!!!.  \n\nFor starters I ordered the Guacamole with chips.  Excellent choice to begin with. As my friends, they ordered their drinks ranging from an old fashion margarita to 99 Problems (and I ain't 1 of them).  We ordered more apps including the queso fundido, carne asada quesidilla and more drinks for some of us.  \n\nOverall it was a Happy Happy Hour!  Larger group can order more of the apps to try.  Will come back while I am still in the hood for now.  The visit was between Xmas and NY so it was quieter but I have passed this place during it's peak (summer) and you can bring your dog to outside patio or outer patio like when  it was during the last place here.  Great Service!\n\nLa Puerta, welcome to Mission Hills.\nGuacamole n chips to start",

Their Mission Hills location just opened and it's only 12 minutes from my house.  Mind officially blown.  \n\nFirst of all, the restaurant is gorgeous, chic, open, fun and has a nice vibe.  My hubby and I have always loved sitting at the bar, talking to those around us and watching the action which is exactly what we did during their soft opening.  \n\nWe started with a classic margarita, on the rocks and with a salted rim.  Delicious and just the right kick.  Next came the queso fundido which was bubbling hot, had a great cheese pull, and the perfect amount of naughty grease to tingle the taste buds.  Then came the potato flautitos with a cheese sauce.  They were delicate, miniature fried potato flautas that I couldn't get enough of.  And if that wasn't enough, we ordered a chicken quesadilla which is our favorite.  I know it's odd to say a quesadilla is your favorite, but the chicken adds a nice grilled flavor and pairs well with the white cheese running throughout when dipped in the smoky red salsa.  \n\nThe staff is always amazing and I enjoyed watching them give lessons on mezcal and mixing the drinks behind the bar.  \n\nI'll be back, La Puerta, so please save me and the hubby two seats at the bar.  See you next time.\nSee all photos from Tammie W. for La Puerta\nUseful 4\nFunny 1\nCool 2\nHailey P.\nBusiness Owner",

                  "review": "5 photos\nFirst to Review\nThe new branch of La Puerta has replaced The Patio on Goldfinch in a prime spot in the middle of the Mission Hills neighborhood. Today was their first day of business with a limited operating schedule of 3 to 11 pm on Thursday through Sunday. The place was over half full when I came by for a late dinner. The menu seemed to be the same as that of the downtown location. The 1 lb burritos, traditional and special, were the calling cards as they occupied an entire page.\n\nI chose the Mix 'n Match from the list of seven Signature Street Tacos. Any three tacos were served with vegetarian refried beans and rice. My selections were the Carne Asada (arrachera steak, guacamole, pico de gallo), Cochinita (achiote pork, pickled onion), and Pastor (adobo pork, pineapple, guacamole, pico de gallo). The best of the bunch was the Cochinita because the pickled onion provided an acidic contrast to the meat.\n\nThese were true street sized tacos so I wish the price for the plate was less than $17. Even with the beans and rice, the amount of food wasn't a good value. My server was apologetic for being slow to take my order, but things went fine afterward. The ambiance of the suite was very nice as they inherited a pleasant, open space from their predecessor. Overall, I gave a 3.5 star rating for my dining experience and rounded up as improvements will be made after the operation gets up to full speed.\nSee all photos from Emmett T. for La Puerta",

Recommend the purple haze which is a nice treat made of sangria and a margarita mixed together.  Loved the TJ dog and fries.  The veggie quesadillas were good.

I have had so many fond memories and so many wonderful meals here with friends and family. I'm thrilled to see it back open, with fresh flair, delicious eats, and a new lease on life! La Puerta, welcome to Mission Hills!\nWe are so glad you are here.\n\nChris and Jacob took wonderful care of us. We have been trying to come here for a few weeks but we weren't sure when they were open. It was delightful to walk by tonight and see that they were open! I immediately stopped in with my husband for a quick late dinner. We were not disappointed!\n\nWe got two margaritas: the \"whole lotta love\" and the \"low rider.\" Both were tasty, classic margs. For food, we started with a (drumroll), half order of their incredible guacamole! A little known secret - this was the perfect amount for two. Their guacamole is some of the best I have ever had...and I'm a San Diego native. They don't mess around. It's incredible!\nNext, we had the mix and match street taco plate with shrimp, chicken, and slow roasted carnitas. All were excellent, my personal fave was the chicken! (You can also add a taco on for a few extra dollars which is good to know.) The beans, rice, and creamed veggies that came with the plate were all excellent.\n\nApparently they do DAILY half-off happy hour from 3pm-5pm and everything is half price behind the bar! I believe their appetizers are half off as well.\n\nLast but not least, they have an amazing classic rock vibe, from their menus with record album covers, to their playlist in the restaurant, to the David Bowie wallpaper in the restroom.\nLa Puerta is where you want to be.\n\nDon't delay, head to La Puerta immediately for an amazing \"mex-perience.\"\nSee all photos from Kelsey S. for La Puerta\nUseful 2\nFunny\nCool\nHailey P.\nBusiness Owner",

The restaurant/bar itself is awesome, so much great indoor and outdoor space. Service was excellent. Even though it took long to get our food, the food was great as usual! I love the California burrito and queso fundido the best. House chips and salsas are fresh and delicious.

We were there the first time last week and went again yesterday and both times it felt normal. It has been too long since we've been in a restaurant that felt this good. Last week our waitress was Jess and this week it was Kyleigh, both ladies were absolutely awesome. We never lacked for anything, the ladies were on top of it and were absolutely pleasant. They took the time to chat with us, talk about the menu and even mention some of their favorites.  We will be back next week again and will be bringing friends with us.

I used to attempt going to the one in Gaslamp on a taco Tuesday, would have to wait forever for a table, and deal with crowds and yelling over the noise etc.  Came up to Mission Hills for a Taco Tuesday in February, found a parking spot on the street 1 block away and walked over.  I was pleasantly surprised that the restaurant had many tables seated, but also had plenty of open tables at 7pm.  We were seated right away and service was great.  The 4 of us arrived at all different times, and the waitress came over each time someone new came to take their drink order and check on if we wanted appetizers.  There's a 3-5pm happy hour that is unlikely I'd ever be able to make it to, but Tuesdays taco tuesday special is $3 a la cart tacos.  So you can mix and match and get 3 tacos for $9!!  It won't come with the rice and beans or other side, but in my opinion that's better, the 3 tacos were plenty filling (with an appetizer of chips and salsa).  I also would highly recommend the mezcal/gin/carrot drink (I forget what it was called), but it was soooo good.  The right amount of smoky mezcal and carrot flavor (super flavorful, but not too sweet).  Paying was a breeze, she brought over the credit card machine, split the bill down the middle 4 ways, and took each of our cards to ring them up.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\nHailey P.\nBusiness Owner",

The frozen margaritas were delicious and I'd highly recommend the sangria one, followed by a spicy margarita with tajin on the rim. We each ordered something different after gorging on the salty chips and guacamole, and I went with the waiter's recommendation of the Torta. SO GOOD. The host even brought over a bowl of a mysterious mol\u00e9-looking sauce, but it was a salty and tangy sauce with crema drizzled on top. I dipped that massive sandwich right in after each bite.\n\nLooks wise - I loved the mood lighting at night and open air feel of the whole space. The interior designer couldn't decide on one theme, so depending on where you're looking, the restaurant's vibe could be Rainforest Cafe, industrial, hipster Bali, David Bowie's #1 fan, or 90's rap enthusiast.\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool\nHailey P.\nBusiness Owner\n10/8/2021\nHi Stevie -\nWe are so happy you stopped by and have us a try even though we don\u2019t have plastic chairs!!

It's not too far from my parents' house, so I'm excited for another great restaurant to head to when I visit. First some promising COVID notes: the entirety of the restaurant opens up like a garage door, so the ventilation is extremely good, which is always nice these days. We were greeted by a friendly very host and immediately seated. Within two minutes, our server introduced herself, took our drink orders, and made menu recommendations. The guacamole here is delicious, so fresh, citrusy, and GREEN! I ordered a taco plate with two chicken tacos and one carne asada taco. The chicken was all white meat and juicy -- not dry. The carne asada was very well seasoned, tender, and not overcooked. The corn tortillas were soft and tasted freshly steamed. It's easy to occasionally overlook some rice as a throwaway side dish, but the rice and beans that came with my meal were so fresh and moist. Also, the vibe here is a very cool homage to classic and punk rock, but not in a cheesy way. I'm back on the east coast now and regretting I didn't go one more time before I left San Diego. The good news is I'll be back in a few weeks, which means I get to eat La Puerta's excellent food again soon.\nDelicious tacos.

These fries weren't the typical lazy shredded cheese that's barely melted with some Pico de Gallo on top; they were absolutely flavorful and rich and well balanced!

                  "review": "Restaurant Manager at La Puerta is abusive towards my husband!\n\nI was so looking forward to eating at La Puerta today.  This location has been through some challenges and I was going to congratulate them for finally opening.   However, after my party sat down, the music was blaring so loud you had to speak up to be heard.  We sat there for a little while, checking out the menu.  There is not very much on it.  The noise was getting to be too much, so I walked back to speak to a person who obviously looked like the restaurant manager.  I asked him if he could \"please lower the sound level of the music\".  \"I feel like I am in a disco\".  I did use the word please, I don't think please is in this man's vocabulary.  He obviously did not know what it meant.  So this is what happened after I went back to my table.\n\nThe restaurant manager walked around a little as if to listen to the music himself.  He then came to our table.  This is what he said!  \"You have no right to speak to my employees the way you did\".  Remember now, I was talking to him the whole time.  Oh, he did have 2 employees within ear shot of our conversation.  But make no mistake about it, I was talking directly to him.  He went on to continually berate me for the way I was asking to have the music turned down.  I had to finally stop him and tell him, \"Look, I am the customer here, you have to right to speak to me the way you are now\".  He continued to berate me so I got up from the table as if to leave and he said \"Good, you need to go\".  Now mind you, I asked him to \"please turn down the music because I felt like I was in a disco\".\n\nThis is all happening in front of my friends that we have asked out for lunch.  I have my husband and his sister (in wheel chair) with her care giver.  We chose La Puerta because of the proximity to our home.  They have a down town location that is better.  After I left, he continues to yell at my husband from what I was told.  Remember, my husband was not a party to any of the discussions I had with La Puerta's Restaurant Manager.  My husband has recently had a stroke and this man was yelling at him.  This man is a danger to customers and needs to be removed.  Then (according to my husband) this jerk tried to apologize to him after my husband pointed out that he was not the one the Restaurant manager should be yelling at.  If you want to yell at someone, yell at my husband, not at me.  The restaurant manager tried to apologize for his behavior.   But then, according to my husband, he went off on my Husband again yelling at him.  He later offered complimentary tequila shots.  But meanwhile, I was still kicked out of the Restaurant not enjoy my friends lunch with my friends.  There is no way to \"make that up\".\n\nThis is so upsetting to me personally.  I had to get myself a sandwich for lunch since I was essentially kicked out of La Puerta!  As far as the food goes, my friends told me it was lousy.  The Carnitas Street Tacos were soggy, mediocre.  The Shrimp salad was way too salty.  Carne Asada Casadilla was ok.  The guacamole was over mixed and tasted mostly of lemon.  The Queso Fundido with Rajas came sans Rojas and by the time the Rajas arrived to our table the Queso was solid.  My friend said they would never go back.  As for myself, I had a Tri-Tip sandwich from Lazy Acres.  I think I got the \"best end of the stick\"!  :-)\n\nI forgot to add, my husband told me the Restaurant Manager did turn down the volume level of the music.  So after all his abusive behavior towards my husband and myself, he did actually agree with me that the music was too loud.",

I popped in her mostly intrigued by its outdoor but indoor layout and discovered just how amazing this place is. The staff is very friendly, professional, and genuine. Their menu has so much to offer and not only do they do lunch/dinner but also brunch. They have a happy hour every day Tues-Sun from 3-5pm and everything is 1/2 off. I had a few of their cocktails and each one was delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered 2 drinks each and a few apps and our bill was less than $40. Presently, I've been here 4 times and I am still in awe and satisfied every time I leave. MORE people need to know about this place they really deserve it. #whodoesntloveagoodhappyhour\nUseful 1\nFunny\nCool 1\nHailey P.\nBusiness Owner\n12/13/2021",

I wouldn't say it's the most walkable area especially if you're prone to shin splints. Street parking is available but it's a neighborhood so get your insta worthy photos, keep your volume down, and get out of there. There's a beautifully landscaped home next door as well that you may want to take a peek at as well.\nHarper's Topiary Garden",

There are over 50 shrubs, all of which were the existing shrubs on the property and were patiently trimmed and reshaped into their current forms.\n\nIt's someone's private home, so you should definitely not try to enter and step all over it, but it's steep enough to admire at eye level from the sidewalk and to snap pictures from across the street.\nthe gardens\nthe gardens",

It has been months since I have been out, other than to buy essentials like food.\n\nI needed a break from the norm and decided to safely play tourist in town and visit a few \"off the beaten path\" curiosities.\n\nFirst stop was Harper's Topiary Garden!\n\nI haven't been here in years. I was surprised to see a few different topiaries since my last visit years ago.\n\nThere wasn't anyone on a late lazy Sunday afternoon (yay) so I was able to park right across the street.\n\nWe had fun snapping pics with the DSLR, being respectful not walk up and down between the wonderfully cool sculptured bushes. I guess I'll post those nicer photos whenever I actually download them. Haha!\n\nA few cars drove by to snap pics and gawk at the topiaries while we were there, but we essentially had the block to ourselves so it was safe to remove our masks and just be goofy while taking photos.\n\nSomething fun and offbeat to do around San Diego with a nice views of the airport along the way.",

I found this place on Hidden San Diego (hiddensandiego.net/thing\u2026).  \n\nAccording to the article, \"Harper's Topiary Garden was created by a couple who wanted to turn their front yard into a masterful work of art that everyone could enjoy and appreciate.  There are about over 50 life-sized figurines all trimmed by hand. About fifteen years ago, their front garden consisted only of basic shrubs. The owners decided to find a shape for each plant and they began to sculpt the trees inspired by travels she and her husband have taken. They have chosen ideas gleaned while traveling through Asia, Europe, North Africa, Hawaii, and throughout North America.  They have visited famous gardens in Thailand, Botanical Gardens in Portland ME, Bouchard Gardens, Victoria BC.  The owners love people viewing and photographing their garden but please do not go inside.\"\n\nI visited Harper's Topiary Garden (Mission Hills) in August 2020 (5 months after Pandemic started).  The place is beautiful and definitely picture friendly!!  \n\nI went on a Sunday afternoon and probably spent about 15 minutes or so there.  No one was around, so it was comfortable walking around.  Just have to pay attention to cars driving by when you're taking pictures!  I'm a very big fan of the DOG shrub (right side).\n\nENJOY!!",

It's totally a residential area so the parking that's available is just curb spots in front of homes. We were able to take a lot of pictures before we saw the other people pull up so the timing was perfect. There's a cute little box on the side of the house that has books in it that people can either drop off or take from which I thought was really cool. I love that these homeowners landscape their beautiful front yard and make it available to the public, it's really so cool! Mission house is a great area with lots of dining nearby so you could totally make a day of it.",

She couldn't believe I've never been there especially growing up in south west Mission Hills. I brought my kids and husband here after a day at Seaport Village this was our last sight to visit for the day. It was a bright sunny day perfect breeze up there and a magnificent view behind us. The treasure was all in front of us as we drove up the hill. You will find street parking right in front- you don't even have to get out of your car if you don't want to. My kids were so excited to spot out animals faces and shapes. We even found a man holding a flag with a mask on-so current and relatable to the current times we are living in. The white house above is so lovely. I recommend taking a bunch of pics with your loved ones here. The garden is well taken care of, gorgeous, unique, and can't be missed!\nSee all photos from Laura C. for Harper's Topiary Garden",

This place came up on my search so decided to check it out.\n\nHaha, driving in the neighborhood to reach this spot kinda reminded me of driving in SF lol rolling hill streets and you go up up up.\n\nNeat garden, I commend the creator of such art. It seemed a little overgrown at the time that I went though as I couldn't make out several of the structures. This place is pretty much a quick stop; spent about 10 minutes here and other sightseers (there were only a couple) did the same.\n\nAs it's on a hill and fairly close to the bay, you can enjoy a fresh breeze here also. Great quick break from checking SD spots that have heavy tourism.\nWhat the creatures see every day",

I found out about this on a travel app that I use. This yard embodies 2 things that I love, art and nature. To be able to see the work that goes into maintaining this and their contribution to their community has to be appreciated. I'm sure there are some neighbors that may not be fans of the visitors but they have to recognize the beauty that it brings when people drive up the hill. I watched a little video on YouTube and Mrs. Edna Harper (the owner) was inspired by her travels. Her and her husband have a gentleman by the name of Pedro that manifests her ideas and maintains the garden daily. At least 5 hours a day! You can see that it is a labor of love.\n\nIf you have a few minutes and want to get away from the tourist traps this is a place that has charm and it's great for photos.\nOn a hazy day it still looks beautiful.\nA work of Art.",

Getting there was an adventure with the hilly roads I felt like I was in San Francisco. I disliked how I had to stop at the light on a hill when the car always feels like its going to roll backwards instead of forward when you let go of the foot brake. I had to use one foot to hold the brake and the other foot to press the gas pedal as soon as I had enough space in front of my car I could press the gas pedal to drive up another hill towards the residential area. This hidden gem I recommend only those who are in for an adventure on their own even if its scary or with someone who likes hilly roads.\n        Once I got there I parked and was able to enjoy the beautiful animals and other topiary's at this garden. This was a very unique topiary garden. It looked like they put a lot of time and effort to keep this garden looking amazing green and sculptured in shapes. Good place to take selfies or just pictures of the garden. Pretty tourist attraction.",

The garden is perfectly hedged and I do recommend heading to the garden near sunset, to the west of the garden you can enjoy a gorgeous sunset with your loved ones!

Smiles, abound!\n\nIf you are in San Diego,  do stop in to see the topiaries, it will certainly brighten your day.

It's a super quick streetside attraction, with some steep hills to drive up for 5-10 minutes of gazing in awe. Some of the topiary sculptures are less obvious, leading to Rorschach debates of bushes instead of clouds. Since it's someone's well-curated yard, just stroll along their curb to admire it before sundown... feels too weird an idea to go up their stairs, and signage politely asks you to keep off. Tons of bees during flowering season, so beware accordingly. Thanks, \"Edna Scissorhands\"! It made for a neat conversation piece between our dinner reservations and return to the airport.\nThe work of \"Edna Scissorhands\"!",

Don't get me wrong - I'm a fan of topiaries and gardens, but to call this garden the best-kept secret of San Diego is a title that I don't think this location reaches.\n\nThere's an overwhelming amount of topiaries. If you're a San Diego local, there's no problem with spending your time trying to identify each topiary. As a SD tourist, I found looking at the topiaries boring as I would rather spend my time exploring what else SD had to offer.  \n\nThe houses within the neighborhood are nice to look at (on the side with the topiary.) Some of the homes parallel to the topiaries  are not as appealing.\n\nI would recommend visiting Balboa Park's botanical gardens over this, unless you are a huge fan of topiaries.\nMy favorite topiary..

Worth taking a picture. The garden is just breath taking! Haven't seen so much green in awhile. And, if you're a fan of the movie \"Edward Scissorhands\" well here you go! There's no parking fees because it's on a residential area. There's street parking. It's just a little steep drive up but, totally worth it.\nWorth the quick go-see, .",

I've always loved coming by here for no other reason than that it is fun to look at and incredibly impressive as this is someone's home and not truly an attraction like a public place. It was really nice to read that even the neighbors genuinely don't mind the visitors and I only hope that remains that way because it would break my heart to learn of or see anyone disrespect this place by being noisy or leaving trash or overstaying their time even if sidewalk is public property. How can this even get anything other than a five star review?! It's a bit odd to even write a review since once again, this is merely a not so little known neighborhood treasure that I have had the privilege of growing up with. Just curious...I've always heard rumors about a house with a moat somewhere in this general area. Has anyone ever actually seen this place? My dad who delivered televisions for Rocky's while he was in college claims to have some recollection of this place but even he seemed to be unsure about whether he had been there or only heard about it. Regardless, this place is definitely worth at least a drive by and it's very neat to find this on Yelp!. My thanks to the property owners for sharing this with us. My best to them and surrounding community always.",

There's whales and surfers, a man taking a siesta, and a couple hand-in-hand at the top. There's a man walking a dog - look for the random piece of ribbon that serves as the dog's leash!

Lots of pointy heads, elephants that melded together, bear-like creatures with tree branch antlers, obese giraffes with conical necks, blobs of semi-cuddly, exaggerated monsters that could be from any corner of children's programming.  \n\nOccasionally a face would pop out among the greenery: yelp.com/biz_photos/topi\u2026\n\nWish I could have met the owner.

Why WOULDN'T she step outside to chit chat with people ogling her yard?  Why WOULDN'T she want to keep an eye on the visitors?  Apparently she has to deal with people climbing on the yard, even though the sign out front (\"Please Don't Touch or Climb Hill\") is explicitly clear to anyone familiar with the English language.\n\nTo be honest I had a tough time making out a lot of the shapes during a visit to the garden a couple weeks ago; I'd say my recognition rate was roughly 50%.  Now, though, I'm really admiring the photo that Amy S. posted; the photo's lighting and from-across-the-street vantage point defintely make more of the animal shapes pop.  I like the elephant(s) the most!\n\nSuper-easy to access off the I-5 and plenty of residential street parking.  If you're in the area, then this little wonderland near the intersection of Union Street and Vine Street is worth a quick stop.\nSee all photos from Kristin B. for Harper's Topiary Garden",

In fact, that very temptation was enhanced by the fact that this is the front-yard garden of a private home. Oh well, perhaps in return for my telling you the secret you'll agree to politely admire the garden from the street and not make a nuisance of yourself.\n\nIt's a topiary garden on the front lawn of 3549 Union Street, tucked away in that little corner of, well, what is it? Hillcrest? Mission Hills? Banker's Hill? Wherever it is, this isn't a place you'd likely stumble upon unless you were looking for it. But it's really massive, truly beautiful, absolutely enchanting and well worth a visit. Whoever tends it must put in hours of work and would probably appreciate the appreciation, just as long as you don't bother them.",

There's also a guy on a surfboard (SD beaches!), a tribute to Edna's cat Lucy, Mickey Mouse, and many more! I thought it was pretty cool that one was shaped like Pedro, haha.\n\nIt was a quick, fun stop in SD. We really appreciated that Alex took the time to give us the story behind this treasure!\nPedro!!!\nTopiary Garden",

I parked down the street and walked him up to it -- definitely wasn't anything he would've expected. We sat across the street for awhile and admired the creativity. Sort of like gazing at clouds and using your imagination to dream up what these bulbous figures could be... I think I'll take my fam to marvel at it next time they're in town.\n\nThank you homeowners and yelpers!\nlooking up at the masterpiece",

Over the years, they have both worked on designing and maintaining the garden.  They are ably assisted by a gardener.  I thought it would interest readers to know how this garden came to be since it is so wonderfully unique - very much like the artists who have designed it.\n\nAbout fifteen years ago their front garden consisted only of basic shrubs.  Our aunt explained that she wanted to find a shape for each plant and they began to sculpt the trees inspired by travels she and her husband have taken.  They have chosen ideas gleaned while traveling through Asia, Europe, North Africa, Hawaii, and throughout North America.  They have visited famous gardens in Thailand, Botanical Gardens in Portland ME, Bouchard Gardens, Victoria BC.  She mentioned the work of Mr. Pearl, a noted topiary artist in the South.  \n\nRecently my aunt traveled to Egypt and hence the three pyramids inspired by the three in Giza.  The collection includes a surfer, elephants ridden by monkeys, a rooster, a buddha, their gardener, pyramids, a whale, bunnies, dogs, and a number of other delightful animals.\n\nThey love for people to drive by and enjoy their beloved garden and only ask that viewers PLEASE DO NOT CLIMB amongst the shrubs.  The topiaries are delicate with no internal structure and a portion of a tree could easily snap away when someone pushes against it.  They charge nothing for viewing their garden and do this solely out of love.  Come and enjoy their artistry!",

This is a collection of very strange garden sculptures that you can spend a good 10-15min looking at, and it's located pretty centrally- just east of the 5 and close to the airport.  This was one of few spots we stopped at during a date night of strange SD sights (5th st bridge, spruce st suspension bridge, victorian village, etc.).  I think these strange things are definitely better explored as a set (so you're not expecting too much out of any one thing), and the garden definitely helped round out the list.  Although we've lived in SD 10+ years, neither of us had been here before, and it may not be a big attraction in and of itself, but I'd say it's worth a stop!  Just don't expect too much and take it for what it is.",

I had to get out of the car and stare as my brain pulled apart the different shapes and forms that were trimmed into the bushes on the hillside and then put them back together into a story just like you do when you stare at a drawing.\nSo Thank You!\n\nIf you do come to check out what these cool homeowners did be respectful of their home and neighborhood; so don't climb all over their property or double park your car in the middle of the street.

Local flavor at its' finest... & it sure looks like it gets a lot of maintenance with all the bushy figures they've got going on.\n\nTo the homeowners and neighbors: Sorry for creepin' around, but I'm sure you should be used to it by now. Great job to those who maintain it, it's awesome.\n\nThe only thing that sucked was the fact that there was a red car parked in front of the \"garden\" that ruined all my pics. Blah! I say, paint the curb red! A beautiful masterpiece like this should be photographed without any disruptions (i.e. red car *cough cough*).",

The actual garden is nice but YOU CANNOT WALK THROUGH IT!!  That dissapointed me, but oh well, it was lovely and quite a nice site probly like a small wonder, but nothing I would jump major hoops to find. If you are out and about site seeing this would be nice to swing buy, ALSO!! BECAREFUL, it doesn't have a walk way so when you get out to look you have to walk in the street probably not the best to take your kids out, more for driving buy.\nYOU ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO TOUCH THE GARDEN! SORRY ALL!! DON'T WORRY SHE DIDN'T HARM THE DOLPHIN. I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT TILL AFTER\nSee! I told you the kids would be in the street if they get out of the car to look at this site!",

But keep in mind it is a private residence, not a publicly maintained park, so don't expect park benches and sidewalks.   Beverly T.'s review also says to watch your step, but you don't need to worry about that because you aren't supposed to walk on the garden anyway.  These types of bushes can be easily damaged if you walk on the soil or brush up against them.  Please make sure we all admire from the street so others can enjoy the garden for many years to come!  I recently met the owner (who is not an old lady, by the way) while on my morning walk. She was extremely nice, proud of her garden and happy that others enjoy it too.  Please appreciate the art she so generously shares with the community, but also respect it and the surrounding neighborhood.",

As we were standing across the street looking at the topiaries  the owner drove up to his driveway on a Harley. He parked and came over and explained the garden and told us how his wife had a vision and started drawing the designs on paper  and when they travel she brings her travels back home and develops them into topiaries. She has a gardner that helps her and it is a lot of work. Please be  respectful of the property and the neighbors.  We found (and were pointed out to by the owner) a southern bell on the left upper, pyramids, elephants, shamu, monkeys, serpent, and many more.

Plenty of natural light is let in as the restaurant has two garage doors that are open during business hours. It makes for great photos and being able to enjoy the warmth of the sun during your meal.\n\nI got the pad se ew with tofu, and it was good, but not as flavorful as I was expecting. I like my tofu crispy and this was not at all, however the portion was plentiful and there were fresh ingredients used. My friend got the pad Thai which looked a lot more flavorful, and she really liked it.\n\nParking is limited in a small lot next to the restaurant, but there is also street parking. Most of the street parking requires you pay for a few hours.\n\nOverall, I would come back. The food was good, and the setting made for a nice lunch. Walk across the street to grab ice cream to top off your meal or get the mani sticky rice at what de health .",

Thai food with a cold Singha is perfection.\n\nWe started with the fresh rolls. Because they are supposed to be healthier, there are no extra noodles inside. Bummer. But they were good and I hear the peanut sauce is yummy. (Yup, allergic to peanuts). The drunken noodles spice level 8 with calamari was so good. Perfect spice level for me.

I liked their spacious open dining area that was nicely decorated. On the evening of my visit, only a few tables had customers so I had my choice of seating. The menu categories spanned from appetizers, salads, soups, noodles, fried rice, stir fried dishes, curries, and house specials. Only one page of the menu was on display at a stand outside the front entrance so it underestimated the restaurant's offerings.\n\nThe Moo Yang was my appetizer which was four skewers of marinated BBQ pork seasoned with a blend of herbs and served with a tamarind sauce. The meat had plenty of flavor, and I didn't need to use much of the sauce. For an entree, I chose the Drunken Noodles with calamari as a protein. The sauteed flat rice noodles had onions, bean sprouts, bell peppers, and basil as garnishments. I asked for the chili garlic sauce to be mild on their spiciness scale. Their version of this item did not live up to my expectation as the portion size was meager for $15. The flavor profile was not strong either.\n\nWhile the starter was worthy of four stars, the noodles were at a three star level at best compared to other Thai spots in town. I gave my experience at What De Health Thai a 3.5 star rating.\nSee all photos from Emmett T. for What De Health Thai",

I thought if my food which was outstanding as a take-out order, how much better could it be if I dined here. Well, let's just say I can't wait to come back! First off, they have a nice dining room, and it takes advantage of San Diego's beautiful year-round weather. We sat at their high top table which could seat 8, and it was right next to their open air doors facing Fort Stockton St. The meals ordered were: Salmon Curry, Stir-Fried Eggplant w/ Chicken, and their Spicy Noodles x2. One of us had a glass of red wine & I had a glass of Singha Thai lager beer. From what my party told me, they all loved it. Staff was extremely friendly, food was served fresh & hot, dining room couldn't have been better, restrooms were clean, they were welcomed separate checks, and two of us took home an additional to-go order. I can't wait to return to try other dishes of theirs.\nStir Fried Eggplant w/ Chicken (spice level 5) & brown rice. Delicious!!!\nSalmon Curry\nUseful 7\nFunny 5\nCool 7",

The owners are very friendly. The menu is typical Thai choices. We ordered the Fresh Rolls, Tom Ka Soup, Padthai, and Panang Curry. The dishes came very quickly. We could taste the freshness of the ingridients from the start. Wow, the aroma and taste were fantastic. The spice was just right.\nWe ask to sit in the corner, really romantic. Ambiance was great. Nice bright interiors whit large garage door type for plenty of ventilation. Great Job. We will definitely come back again very soon. Thank you.",

Some of these folks were the same crew from Issara Thai out in Point Loma near Liberty Station. Issara closed down there and some of the team relocated to here. Great choice!\n\nMy go to is chicken Pad Thai with a slice of lime. The pad thai was amazing! Their pad thai was on the more savory side with nice sprinkles of peanuts all over. It has very nice flavor but it doesn't really over saturate the taste bud with any single dominant taste. Got a great mix. If you like spicy, just crank up the spice and ask for thai hot.\n\nMy table got some other stuff and based on what I heard, they enjoyed it. Definitely lots of good stuff to pick from on the menu.\n\nThe location is great! Its in a nice walk friendly location. Parking could be a bit tricky though. Chances are you're gonna be on the street and you're gonna be walking. That's fine, eat more food and walk it off going back to the car.\n\nWould I come back? Heck yea! I want more of that pad thai!! I should try some of the other stuff but I have a real weakness to good pad thai.",

Every single dish that we ordered was spectacular. It's rare to experience a restaurant that blows you away with every single bite. So... what did we order? For appetizers we got a bowl of the house soup and the Mieng Kham(highly recommend this one). Both dishes were incredibly fresh and tasty. Though the appetizers were excellent, the entr\u00e9es were the absolute star of the show. I ordered the Sweet Basil Pumpkin stirfry with chicken and, honest to God, this was probably one of the best dishes I've ever eaten in my life... my parents ordered the ginger spice stir fry and the Mussaman Curry which were equally as exceptional.\n\nThe staff is unbelievably kind and attentive and they even recognized me from last time! The dessert that they treated us to was absolutely incredible and made our night.\n\nRun, don't walk. What De Health is a gem and your taste buds deserve this cooking as much as they deserve your business. Wish I could give more than 5 stars! :)))",

I got the pad see ew with chicken. I actually asked the server which she preferred - pad Thai or pad see ew and she said pad thai but my gut took over and I went with the latter. I'm so glad I did! It was the perfect blend of savory with a touch of sweet. The veggies were perfectly crisp and the noodles weren't soft or soggy. My friend got the curry fried rice and they warned her and said they lean towards to hotter on the star scale (she ended up getting 4 stars and she was panting enough ). She loved her dish too. This is a great neighborhood spot I'd def recommend. Next time I'll try the pad Thai\nPad see ew with chicken\nCurry fried rice",

The Pad Thai wasn't as spicy as I was hoping for at 7, but my soup seemed a bit spicier so maybe there was a spice mixup. Regardless, the quality of the dishes was on point and the pricing was more than fair. I ordered take out and the food was hot and ready on time. The restaurant itself is really cute, clean, and has plenty of seating. Staff were all wearing masks and the customer service I encountered was personable.

The service was excellent and everyone we encountered was friendly, gracious and had a smile on their face (from what we could tell behind their masks!)\nMy mother-in-law and I loved our dishes of Pad Thai and Yellow Curry. Generous portions and very tasty. If you can't handle spice, a 2 might be too spicy. Worked for me, but my Aussie MIL would have preferred a 1 or 0, but she still ate the dish since it was so tasty. Can't wait to go back.",

I ordered the stir fry broccoli with medium heat and mock duck. Very disappointing. The dish was swimming in grease (gross!) and they even forgot to put in the chili! It also had very little flavor.\n\nTo be fair, my two lunch companions were mostly satisfied with what they ordered (although both felt that our usual Hillcrest Thai place is cheaper and much better).\n\nI won't be returning.

But, the dishes that we got tonight were super unique - totally different from any other restaurant - and really good!  The presentation was also top-notch, and the service was excellent.\n\nAt the recommendation of our server, we had the Ginger Chicken Salad, Zuchinni Pad Thai, and Salmon Curry Special.  All of the dishes had great flavors and tasted super fresh. They were healthy, but didn't compromise on flavor at all. They were also large portions. We left totally full, but not bogged down by a greasy meal.\n\nWhat de Health has a weird name, but it's a great addition to Mission Hills! I hope it succeeds!\nSalmon Curry\nZucchini Pad Thai",

I have had plenty of Thai food but the dish I got tasted so strange that I had to send it back. It was inedible. None of the other Thai food We ordered was anything special according to my husband and our two foodie friends. It did not justify the prices either.\n\nThe servers did not seem very experienced. We tried to get the servers attention when we needed something, but she was having a really good time joking with the hostess and it took forever to get her to help us.\n\nThis place has excellent reviews and was recommended by a friend. I guess anybody can have an off night, but our experience was so unpleasant we don't want to go back and give them a second chance.",

For celiac and gulten-free folks, the menu is very clearly labeled as to what is and is not gluten-free.  Spicyness is from a scale of 1 to 10.  I tried my drunken noodles at a 5.  that was spicy!  The chicken satay was very good, too.  Very tender and flavorful. I look forward to my next meal from here!",

We ordered 45 minutes before they closed which may have been the problem. The food definitely wasn't fresh and definitely has me questioning if I want to order from them again. We ordered the panang curry with tofu and Thai basil stir fry with chicken. The vegetables and tofu weren't cooked thoroughly which makes it seem like they just threw it together last minute and didn't care what they served us. The curry was so watery instead of a creamy texture. The portions definitely varied also. I would rather of had them tell us they didn't have time since it was 45 min til closing instead of serving mediocre food that wasn't up to their standards. Pretty disappointed...",

Alcohol is allowed, but don't bring any glass.  So, yes, it is a good park to host gatherings.  No permits are needed for parties less than 50.  We were able to put up a tent and set up tables.\nAt the moment, parts of the park are closed off to plant grass, but normally, there is plenty of space for everyone and lots of locals come to walk their dogs.\nThey have lots of shady areas so it's nice on a hot day.  If you are in the right place, you have a gorgeous view of the bay!\nYes, there is a cemetery...of the early inhabitants of San Diego. So the park is actually a cool historic site.\n\nThere is a small parking lot, and usually plenty of easy street parking.  They have a public restroom with plenty of TP, soap and running water.  It could be cleaner, but I guess I can't be too picky about a park bathroom.\nSunset\nSunset",

Just make sure you don't bring any glass with you And check out the San Diego parks and rec website before going just to make sure that none of the rules have changed. The park is not huge but definitely has enough space for people to be spread out and is scattered with some picnic tables as well. One corner of the park has a kids play area. There is lots and lots of shade which is really great. This park also has its own parking lot and if that happens to be full then there is curb parking all around since it is nestled away in a residential neighborhood. I really love this park and think the history is quite interesting. Make sure to check out the tombstones if you come by!",

Such a classic park in San Diego, an old school one at that, so old there's a graveyard in the back corner of the park. Yes it is haunted, and don't try to go there on Halloween, that's been played out way before our generation.\n\nThe park is great for sports practice, picnics, large parties, and for kids to let out all their energy at the playground and tot park. Also, a beautiful place for professional photography.\n\nThe neighborhood is safe, people are nice, the park is clean, they have public bathrooms, picnic benches and tables, it is dog friendly, and free parking in a small lot or on the street. It's attached to Grant Elementary School so when the kids get out of school is probably the busiest time.\n\nKeep cool on a hot day under the shaded trees. I like bringing my son and dog here to play and then enjoy a picnic. It is so peaceful, quiet, and you can hear the planes fly in to Lindbergh Field near the west side. It's nice to still be able to enjoy a place that has not been ruined or changed-it's completely the same as when I was a young child. Not crowded or busy either.",

Being mostly tucked away from the rest of Mission Hills, it seems fairly untampered from less traffic.\n\nThe surrounding houses are gorgeous.\n\nWe came here for the concert in the park, where a band came from Orange County and took us back to the English Invasion.\n\nWe brought our own little picnic of fruit, cheese, and beverages.  Many people danced.  In a world of new garbage music, it was nice to see the older folks have some fun with timeless music from the 60s.\n\nParking:  Street.  Tougher when there's an event, but you will find it eventually the further away you drive.",

My grandmother lives in Mission Hills so we would go to the park on summer nights when there was live music, we would take a picnic or walk around the graveyard, yes...graveyard.\n\nThe park is situated in the heart of Mission Hills and is absolutely gorgeous and serene.  My sister actually had her wedding ceremony in the park and it was beautiful, surrounded by old trees that provide a good amount of shade.\n\nThere is a cool graveyard in the back of the park and it is worth the time to go look at the old headstones.  They are pretty neat.  There are also public restrooms and there is a playground which is great for kids of all ages.\n\nThe park is right next to Grant Elementary so it can get pretty packed around 2pm. When I am in town, I have taken my nephew to play until my cousin gets out of school.  It works great!  In the summer there is always something happening for free in the park.\n\nThis is a great family oriented park with a neighborhood feel.  It is safe and there is plenty of parking both on the street and there is a private lot in the back.  If you are looking for a nice way to spend an afternoon having a picnic, taking a walk, playing with kids, going for a run or looking for a summer night event, this is a park for you.",

My friends have sloshball here so it's very fun and also it's great to have a bbq, I do see dogs as well wagging there tails so if you want something different from balboa park this is a cute and intimate park.",

There's tons of shade here, so it's great for a hot day.\n\nThe parking lot is small, but there's plenty of street parking.\n\nThe restrooms don't seem to be very well kept but at least there are restrooms.\n\nOnly downside is that this used to be a cemetery, so there's 3000+ coffins you're chillin on top of.  All the tombstones were removed from the site.\n\nAlso, there seems to be tours going on at night time since it could be a \"spooky\" park.\n\nOverall, I'd come back here to have more BBQs as this is a nice place to have one.",

I don't, but that doesn't stop me and my family from enjoying Pioneer Park in this beautiful neighborhood!\n\nI absolutely love this park. It's huge with lots of tall eucalyptus trees for shade. It's the perfect place to grab a bite to eat from Goldfinch or Washington and have a pic-nic! We actually grabbed a pizza from a place nearby and had a picnic at the park recently - it was so nice! We love the playground for our toddler and all the space for our dog to run around or to play bocce ball! It's not only clean and spacious, but its proximity to the restaurants nearby make it a fun place to start or end a Saturday afternoon!",

I did not get to close to the graveyards, because I had to stay on guard at the playground with my kids.

After that the dead arise and party with glow sticks until the sun comes up. How stupid is that? Well what did you expect me to say... what can you say about a park: it's got grass, trees, benches, bbq's and restrooms with a huge turd peeking out of the toilet. No I didn't try to flush, it wasn't mine and I didn't want anyone to walk in while the toilet runs over washing clay snakes across the floor thinking I clogged the pipes. I don't eat that much fiber. Ugh, I almost threw up in my mouth while writing that.\n\nOn to the good stuff. Ok, so this is the second Unofficial Yelp Event, (UYE) I've attended here and both were a great time. Thanks Nick. You did an awesome job and there was so much food nobody went home hungry. Even the guy collecting aluminum cans got to get in on the food. He was one happy and polite recycler.\n\nSo to sum it up, we had fun, ate lots of food, drank alcohol, met new faces and saw old feces. Good Times!!!",

Of course, this means I love it because its perfect for Apricot to hang out.  The most recent visit was when a friend had a small gathering here.  \n\nYou can review the best restaurant, the best clubs and the best stores in town but for something free, nothing is better than Pioneer Park.  Its clean, it has a playground area for younger kids but most of all its quiet and not too busy.  And don't be shocked at the gravestones in one area of the park, its a tribute to the past when this park used to be one of the first cemeteries in the San Diego area.\n\nTruly a nice place to have a small picnic or a big gathering (a large group was having a party with brew and bbq) .  Lucky to live closeby and enjoy that there is a clean park that you know will be reliable to just walk around in a neighborhood park.",

Great for adults and children of any age!\n\nIt's far too long a story to write here but, if you're interested in some of Calvary Cemetery/ Pioneer park history, hit me up! I go there on a regular basis and have given some presentations on the place.\n\nIMPORTANT: there are no bodies under the headstones.. those are just for show! Yes, they were part of the cemetery but, they were moved to the back on purpose. The bodies are everywhere under all the grass and trees. Yet, NOT under those headstones.\n\nhmmm....",

Its usually pretty dead during weekdays, and there's lots of grass to play Frisbee, or have a picnic. During weekends it gets crowded and theres often large groups of people playing beer games or having bbqs. I just read a review that said all the bodies are still under the grass. EVEN BETTER! I love Pioneer Park!!!",

It's clean, the people are friendly, the grass is green, and there are stands with plastic bags to use when picking up the poops.  Oh, apparently,  there are also dead people under the grass, but I have yet to make their acquaintance.  \n\nEven with the shyness of the deceased, I still enjoy an evening stroll through the park on my way to and from wherever.  Some may consider it macabre or disrespectful to turn a graveyard into a park, but not me.  I hope that one day, when I'm no longer on this side of the grass, that my resting place can do double duty as a place where people find whatever they need, whether it be a spot to kick back and relax, play a game, or hang out with a friend.  That would bring joy to my dusty bones.",

The adults in our group had fun as did the kids that were playing nearby on the swings n crap.\n\nI would prefer that the bathroom stalls had doors but that's so minor it's not even worth mentioning.

From the 1870's to 1960 this \"park\" was a functional cemetery.  In 1970 the city decided that the rundown cemetery was a \"public danger\" and that it needed to go.  So the city trashed all but a handful of the headstones (you can see the remaining headstones in the SE corner of the park), and then didn't move the bodies.  Yes that's right this park that USED to be a cemetery is STILL a cemetery (without headstones) and what is even crazier is that over 4,000 people were buried here from the 1870's up to 1960.  Many notable people are buried in this park: Sea Captains, War Heroes, men and women that played important roles in the history of San Diego, wealthy San Diego area families, and local Catholic Priests and Nuns.  \n\nI think the history of this place is part of the reason why I love this park so much, that and I have had some really good times here with some really good friends!",

There's a school connected just next to the swingset.  Nifty.  I know that the ground is wavy in nature because the land was once a larger graveyard and the graves keep settling so they have to keep repaving the area.  Yikes!\n\nThere is a ton of land here to run around on.  that's a plus.  this part of Washington st doesn't see a lot of traffic during the day, so that makes it feel safer.  I heard there are a lot of dogs here, but I've only seen one.  I just like the fact that it has two play areas, and there is a lot of sand to throw around.  Restrooms are there, and a drinking fountain that you don't have to be right on top of to drink from!  All good!\n\nBehind the tombstones, there is a nature trail that goes into one of the many canyons of Mission Hills, and heads all the way down to Washington St.  That is fun if you want to see a lot of big crows and bums.  Let's be pioneers!",

I actually find that pretty poetic. This park is huge and this last friday was our first visit for a tom petty cover band during concerts at the park. Tons of people were out with their families having a great time. It was an awesome vibe and everyone was happy and just hanging around engaging in end of week festivities and some snacks. definitely recommend for concerts at the park",

There are graves all over the place, but only a handful of the tombstones have been kept (and put off to one side.)  This is the perfect picnic park.  I adore it.  On many a late tipsy night, I have frolicked through the grass with friends.  This is also my primary spot for nighttime picnics.  It's just pretty enough not to be spooky, and just free of people enough not to be annoying.  Take a blanket, some snacks, a bottle or two of wine, and go for it.  Bathroom buddies recommended at night, since a few sketchies can be seen around those parts.\n\nI look very much forward to this Saturday's Yelp Picnic.  More to come...",

It is one of the easiest places to get to on the creepy tour of San Diego, and is also one of two the best places on the tour to bring makeout bait at night, so single people with a penchant for the macabre bring your dates here and comfort them while you examine the gravestones.  Or go during the day and play grab ass.  Whatever.\n\nThere are a bunch of awesome old school big grave markers here, as well as a large number of small ones.  All of the markers are not there anymore, according to the SD Historical Society.  Most of them were brought to an unnamed landfill and unceremoniously dumped. The rest were moved to the east side of the cemetery and taadaa! now San Diego has a park!\n\nI first went to this park after a counseling appointment where I met my friend Chelsea in about July of 1994.  It was day time, and my parents and brother and sister were there, so the radness of standing on graves was tempered by familial interaction.\n\nWhen Sk8 or Die (a band that Brandan P and I did for a while) was given money to make an album for some strange reason, this is where we went to take the liner pics.  We ended up with Brandan, Adam the Drummer, and I on and around the biggest gravestone there.",

Oh wait...what?!?!?\n\nYes Pioneer Park, though I don't have all the history on it used to be a cemetery.. Years later it was converted to a park, a rather nice one in fact. You can have picnics, let the kids run around, and they have a jungle gym..and wait what's that on the other side? Oh yeah.. the tombstones... and so you know YES the bodies of the 3000 or so people are still beneath you where you walk. You can sometimes make out the outline of the graves where they once were. They moved a number of tombstones off to the side and everything else is just grass and well fertilized trees (if you know what I mean) I love the place and it is sort of a all day/night cemetery if you want to get technical with it. Parking is pretty decent.. I don't normally go during the day but at the evening and that's when it can get dicey. Most evenings people are just walking the dogs, but as it gets later you may seem some shady folks and possibly a drug deal..But that is sort of what is expected from a park that sort of doesn't close. (even though gate for parking lot closes by 10pm I believe, it is still accessible by foot)\n\nSo just be careful otherwise and enjoy yourself. It's a neat place. 4.5 out of 5",

Yup, that's right, I had a full-blown wedding here and it was awesome! Was it a goth wedding? Nope, just your average wedding. The theme was Garden Party/Day of the Dead to go with the cemetery part of it but it was awesome and I still get compliments to this day. Like others have said, this is one of the few park where you can drink, which was one of the reasons my husband and I picked it. (You do need a park permit to throw events here but that was such an easy process at the SD Parks & Rec dept.) This park is semi-secluded which is nice and it has some awesome trees here. There is a playground for kids and it's relatively big so you can get your space from other park goers. The one downside of the park is that the bathroom doesn't have doors on the stalls. Overall though, I love this park!",

Some of the tombstones were placed in the back to make room for a large sand box like playground and some picnic tables on one side and a pretty large grassy area.  I like to bring my pup here so she can run around the grassy area.  It's a good place to play fetch with her.  I like the fact that the park is clean and never crowded.  The neighborhood is also nice and quiet.  There is also plenty of parking on the surrounding streets or in the small parking lot.  We occasionally wander into the surrounding trails which can be fun, although I don't recommend doing them alone.",

The Elementary School next to the park uses it as their private playground for the children on a daily basis.  They normally take over a huge amount of the park for their games and running events.  They have an adequate playground, but barely use it. Dog walkers and others that come to enjoy the park, have to dodge the ball games and their running exercises around the park.\nThe most disrespectful actions, are watching the children play on the old, historic gravestones.....while the mothers sit there and watch them.  Not to mention there are monkey bars and a childrens playground available to them.\nThe bathrooms are beyond disgusting.  \nThe plus side, the dogs love to sniff around and see grass, which is usually denied to dogs in San Diego.  \nThe dog people are nice.....the young mothers are trolls, who think they and their little angels own the park, along with the school.\nParents continually park in all the available parking spots when school is over, and again feel it's their right even if they are not there to use the park, or to wait in line on the street.\nI only continue to go there, because it's close to my home, oh and wait.....the mothers have complained to the Park Department that some dogs are off leash.  So a policeman has been sitting there, stating he will give a $250 ticket, if your dog is off leash.  The dogs are well-behaved.....can't say the same for the little darlings crawling all over the historic headstones and the batty mothers.",

                  "review": "What sets Pioneer Park apart from every other park in San Diego is the fact that off in the distance from the playground equipment, nestled in the back corner of the park is a cluster of headstones. This is because way before children frolicked in the perfectly manicured grass, it was a peaceful resting place for the founding settlers of our city. Thus, the name Pioneer Park. There are many stories as to how the transition happened. Just Google the name and you'll find some of them. However, today both the living and the dead seemed to have found a harmony and it comes off as just part of the celebration of life. The play equipment is geared for both toddlers and 5-12 year old's. There is a huge grass area great for picnics and parties. It is one of only four parks where alcohol is allowed. It's a great place to add to your rotation of play places for the little guys. Also, if you want to do some groundhog spotting, we've had great luck with that too! Try in the back of the park by the sit-up benches! The park is on Washington street, right by Grant Elementary school. Here is a great website to learn more about the park! ourmissionhills.com/Park\u2026",

I had the Turkey and Applewood Bacon combination made into the wrap.\n\nThe wrap was quite tasty and came with a good amount of deli sliced turkey and tasty crispy bacon. The onions, tomatoes, and lettuce were all fresh and crisp. The honey mustard was tasty, but I would of liked to have seen more Havarti cheese in the mix.\n\nThis location only has outside seating.

                  "review": "So... my wife worked downtown in a past life. She often frequented the Grab and Go downtown for lunch.\nFor YEARS she told me about this awesome tuna sandwich she would get from there. Literally the only thing she would order.\nI was getting my eyebrows microbladed by Jeanie Clark (look her yo!!!) at Buju Tattoo. Which is up the street from the Grab and Go in Mission Hills.\nI decided to surprise my wife and get a couple of her fave tuna sandwich she had been talking about for years. How delicious it was.\n\nI knew it was the one that didn't have any mayo and had capers.\n\nIt runs out it's the Tunisia.\n\nI called my order in after my brows were done and proceeded to go pick it up.\n\nService was polite and fast. There is no indoor seating. It's just a walk up counter. They had the clear shields up for safety.\n\nMy order was ready when I walked in less than 10 minutes after calling it in. I paid and left.\n\nI must say. It's not a bad sandwich. It was a little lacking on the olive oil, salt and pepper. Because it didn't have enough oil it was a little dry. But this could be an ordering issue. But maybe the person who took my order on the phone could have spent a few extra seconds asking if I had ever had it and given some ordering options (salt and pepper, oil and vinegar, blah blah blah). Or maybe they don't do that. I don't know.\n\nIt wasn't horrible. But I wouldn't pay 8.99 for that particular sandwich that I ate again. I would order it differently. Might I add, they have an array of other sandwiches that sound amazing.\n\nThey have a great reputation and I'm not too put off. I could tell the ingredients were quality. I can see why my wife was so nostalgic.\n\nI'll be back to give it another go.",

I use to always go to the one in downtown, such great food! The menu is larger as well\n\nThis shop is smaller, more limited food items. But hey, still great taste! Unlike the other shops around SD, this one does NOT have coffee. I didn't check to see if they have breakfast items like the other shops though (sorry)\n\nI ordered my usual, Spicy Turkey sub with a wheat wrap and extra cheese.  Was ready In less than 5 minutes which is excellent in my opinion. Of course, delicious as usual!\nThere's one table outside to eat. The inside is more of an order at the counter and then go outside to wait sorta shop.\n\nGreat staff, but please bring in the coffee!! I feel like it would also bring in more of crowd.\nSpicy turkey wrap",

I have had the Italian, Sicilian and other subs.  You can get the full size or half size (which is ideal for my partner who doesn't eat big sandwiches/subs).\n\nThe parking has been great of course since it's located in a strip that has parking for business/retail - Starbucks, Venissimo etc.\n\nPricing is slightly higher than the fast food places like Subway but the quality is better than those others.  I appreciate a quick sandwich/snack. Since I normally order only sandwiches, I am not sure what to recommend for drinks.\n\nPatronizing local businesses especially in our current climate is important for us in the neighborhood of Mission Hills.\n\nThank you.",

Got my usual hot pastrami sub and noticed there is a temporary $2 surcharge on the pastrami sandwiches due to the meat shortage from COVID. I have no issue paying a surcharge to help a local business stay afloat, but I noticed there was not the same amount of meat, but actually less than before. If you are going to charge extra or raise your prices that is fine, but don't give me less than what I'm expecting. $24 for 2 sandwiches is on the pricey end and I feel like I got ripped off. Good tasting sandwiches but I unfortunately won't be returning for awhile, at least until the meat shortage is over. Everyone is affected during the current pandemic, but trying to take advantage of customers thinking its not noticeable, it is. Hopefully they make some adjustments because I really like this place.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n9/28/2019Previous review\nWho knew that little ol Grab & Go literally has the best pastrami sandwhich in SD! So good, this is my 3rd time in a week having it and I have zero shame!\n\nTheir bread rolls are amazingly soft, so I always opt for the cold bread (not toasted).\n\nThe pastrami itself is so incredibly juicy, perfectly thin sliced, not overly salted and they definitely give you a decent portion of it.",

I do like that they put peperoncino. Adds a crunchy yet pickled taste which is not bad at all.\nI will say that got $9 sub I do expect more protein.\nChips and a sub comes out to around $12. I will say that's a little steep.\nI'll suggest a bit more protein for the price of the sub.\n\nOverall experience positive. I will go and grab another sub.",

I opted to add Avocado.  It was easy on the mayo as opposed to wet and mayonnaisee (if that's even a word) they also have nice little salads.  I also like that I could get a smaller portion.  The half sandwich was the perfect size for me.  Go in and support them.  You will not be disappointed.  I wanted to take a picture of my tuna but it was so good I devoured it.",

Not hair, but fuzzies like from clothing. After picking off about 5, I got completely grossed out and threw it away. Cleanliness is always important around food but to have this happen with everything that's going on it makes me concerned with what else is getting on the food other than clothing fibers. Not to mention the waste of $. Eating out has been somewhat of a treat nowadays and I feel like I got ripped off.",

The bread was fresh, soft and warm, the pastrami was thinly sliced and most the fat trimmed off, and not overly salty.  Topped with pickle, finely shredded lettuce, tomato, peppercini  peppers and oil and vin.  Excellent sandwhich.  My got got a turkey however that one was bland though.  If ya want a hot pastrami, this place does a great job.",

We were hungry for some sandwiches to take to the park and I had recalled seeing it as I drove up and down Washington to work every day . Just never made the time to stop. Glad I did! We popped in there one afternoon and the management and staff were extremely nice, offering a wealth of information about their restaurants, foods and where we can find them elsewhere... Everything is made fresh... they are super friendly and helpful. I would highly recommend this or any of their locations for a great sandwich, sweet treat and most of all to support our mom and pop businesses in the San Diego area. I will definitely go here before I do any chain restaurants again. Oh and I had a club sandwich on their fresh baked bread and one of the cookies... So so good I'm actually going to go back today after finally makin the time to write this review!",

Parking is a pain here so be prepared to circle the block a couple of times.  \n\nEnvironment:\nIt felt like a traditional sushi restaurant with a touch of class.  You walk in and to your right they have a wide selection of wines/sake to choose from.  Behind the sushi bar is where chef Hitoshi does his magic.  Service was exceptional, Noriko our waitress described the menu in great detail and provided pairings to go with our meal.  When busy she had help from her lovely partner in crime Soko.  \n\nFood and drinks:\nThere were about 6-7 dishes each with it's own unique characteristics which I cannot do justice by describing so I'll let the pictures do the talking.\nSee all photos from Scott N. for Komatsuya",

We had to make a reservation about a week in advance and were looking forward to trying the Chef's Omakase Course dining experience.  \n\nThe restaurant has a beautiful and clean aesthetic.  When we walked in, we were greeted by a pleasantly friendly female who was extremely attentive throughout our meal.  \n\nThey had an extensive drink selection.  We are sake drinkers, so we ordered the Taka, and it was smooth & delicious.\n\nWe were served each dish over the course of about 2 hours, and were blown away by the presentation, flavors, and uniqueness.  The food was so beautifully presented and was absolutely delicious.  \n\nIn talking with the waitress, she said they had been open about 6 months, and their menu changes twice a month (on the 1st and 16th).  We cannot wait to go back & try a new menu next time.\n\nDo not wait to try this restaurant, it will be the best sushi you will ever have!\nSee all photos from Jen L. for Komatsuya",

There were actually only two other parties dining while we were there.\n\nThe Chef's Omakase Course was the only option available, but we were also able to order extra nigiris at the end. We started off with a bottle of sake to share with the chefs and staff. The first course was the Sakizuke, which came with spiny lobster, asparagus, radish, caviar, and gelee. The presentation was really nice and the lobster tasted great!\n\nThe Zensai was simmered Romanesco, sesame, salmon roe, braised scallop, pickled turnip, yuzu pepper, seared barracuda sushi, and fried lotus root. The plating was gorgeous! The Otsukuri was next, which came with uni, squid, lemon, salt, sesame, seared scabbard fish, ponzu radish, seared zuke, bluefin tuna, and green onion. Each course kept getting better and better!\n\nThe Onmono was yellowtail, turnip, carrot, and green onion. This came\nwith some broth and was very flavorful. Next, was the Niku, which came with A5 Miyazaki wagyu beef jibuni, mashed potato, spinach, heavy cream, and parsley. I liked this dish a lot!\n\nThe pieces of nigiri selected by the chef was wonderful. We ordered a few more pieces of our favorites. I do wish they had more fish options though. The Owan was miso akadashi miso soup, with the fish of the day. We were given something special the chef made, which was tasty and was loaded with fish! I'm not sure what it was called, but it was wrapped in seaweed.\n\nThe last course, was the dessert. It was very light and refreshing and reminded me of panna cotta with a raspberry on top. I love that you don't have to worry about ordering, since the chefs prepare everything for you and course out your meal.\n\nThis place has very fancy plating and has fresh and unique courses, with plush chairs for seating! Service was so friendly too! The chefs and server even walked us to the door on our way out. I wonder how often their menu changes- would love to try some different items next time!\nSee all photos from Dung N. for Komatsuya",

                  "review": "7 photos\nI really hate to give this such a low review as the food was good. However, on a slow Wednesday night where the restaurant was less than half full, our dinner for four turned into a near 4 hour ordeal. Somehow there were  tables that came in after us and left before us. I am not sure how this could have happened?\n\nMy friends and I have been visiting various omakase sushi places in San Diego, and while the food here was good - fresh ingredients, fun flavor/texture combinations, the sushi was just meh. It does seem difficult to visit a place that has both amazing food and sushi. If the entire meal was cheaper or we just had the sushi or just the food, my review would be different.\n\nI took a photo of each dish as it came out, so below are timestamps of our courses:\n\nCourse 1 (burrata cheese and uni): 7:10PM\nCourse 2 (zensai): 7:20PM\nCourse 3 (otsukuri): 8:00PM\nCourse 4 (onmono): 8:20PM\nCourse 5 (niku): 8:35PM\nCourse 6 (6 pieces of nigiri sushi): 9:45PM!!!!!!!\nCourse 7 (owan): 10:00PM\nCourse 8 (ice cream): 10:15PM\nCheck: 10:30PM\n\nThe waitstaff and the sushi chef came out to apologize for the long wait between course 5 and 6. We weren't comped for any part of the food. The sushi that we waited so long for was small, unimaginative, not exciting. Some parts of my fish were falling apart because they were cut so thin.\n\nFor ~$160 per person with NO alcohol, I am really disappointed to say I didn't enjoy my experience. I personally enjoyed the burrata/uni and the zensai the most. Onmono was a bougie tempura dish and owan surprisingly had very little flavor for it being akadashi miso.\nSee all photos from Rina K. for Komatsuya",

                  "review": "12 photos\nKomatsuya made a quiet debut over the summer in the Mission Hills neighborhood. After taking July off, business resumed at this all-omakase restaurant. They rotate items within the menu categories of the omakase about once every two weeks. It's prudent to make a reservation as seating is limited between the sushi bar and the small dining area. My visit occurred towards the end of last month.\n\nThe Chef's Course is offered as regular or vegan, and each has eight categories. I chose the regular and was served the following over a 90-minute sitting:\n* Sakizuke - Burrata cheese with sea urchin\n* Zensai - Trio of brussel sprouts and snap garden peas, lightly fried soy oyster, mushroom and crab\n* Sashimi - Seared yellowtail, seabass, soy marinated bluefin tuna\n* Fish - Steamed grouper with veggies\n* Beef - A5 Japanese Wagyu shabu-shabu with veggies\n* Nigiri - Assorted pieces including halibut, bluefin tuna, salmon roe\n* Owan - Akadashi miso soup with shimeji mushroom\n* Dessert - White peach compote with valencia orange and jelly sauce\n\nEach course was meticulously prepared to give a beautiful presentation. The sauces that were used (e.g. dashi, vinegar jelly, plum soy) complemented the seafood so well. The best was the beef because of the tender, marbled wagyu. My past omakase experiences have been all seafood items so to have meat as one of the courses was a nice change-up. The quality of the food and service were top notch, therefore the price for this dinner was one of my splurge meals for the year.\nSee all photos from Emmett T. for Komatsuya",

                  "review": "5 photos\nWas duped by the few positive reviews and pictures of pretty plates & interior, but after dining I would absolutely not recommend.\n\nTo summarize: the menu has absolutely no focus and was honestly extremely unappetizing.\n\nService was also terrible. No exaggeration, we waited 50 minutes between course 3 & 4 because the servers forgot about us. How we knew? They came over after almost an hour and asked us which course we were supposed to get. Tried to be nice & patient, thought it might just be long prep time but ended up not being the case.\n\nFirst red flags were: we reserved seats at the \"sushi bar\" but surprise, it's just a tacky wall of empty wine bottles completely blockading you from the chef. And speaking of, check out the drink menu, it's a bizarre list of predominantly wines (only by the glass) with very few sake options.\n\nThe food:\n- Our first course was an enormous slice of burrata swimming in a slimy goopy sauce topped with uni & salmon roe. That's right, cheese with seafood. It was awful.\n- Second course, one of the trio of apps was drowned in an extremely vinegary mustard sauce, so you taste no subtlety of the squid or tofu that's under it.\n- Third course, poor otoro that again is drowned in a heavy egg yolk soy sauce, this place has no concept of restraint or subtlety that Japanese cuisine is regarded for.\n- Fourth course, karaage A5 wagyu (what a waste to deep fry) again came with essentially barbecue sauce that just killed the palate for the entire plate.\n- Fifth course, hard overcooked seabass swimming in a goopy broth.\n- The sashimi that we waited so patiently for was so disappointing, not to mention poor execution on the seared snapper with a very strong taste of butane.\n- Dessert: more cheese lol straight up frozen ricotta as \"ice cream\", texture was crumbly and terrible.\n\nWhoever called this a kaiseki obviously has no idea what that means or the progression/courses involved. I almost never do 1 star reviews, but I super regret trying this place, waste of 3 hours with the bad service and ridiculously overpriced for what they're abysmally offering.\nSee all photos from Nayoun K. for Komatsuya",

Definitely make reservations in advanced since they currently have a staff of 3 and can only accommodate a limited capacity of customers as they try to build a solid foundation before hiring more staff.\n\nMenu is Chef's Omakase only for now and definitely reminds me of Kaiseki style.  The ingredients and seafood were fresh, presentation was great and most importantly, everything tasted delicious!\n\nLoved how friendly the staff was.  They asked our opinion on the food and what they could do better and let us know they plan on revamping their omakase menu monthly.  The wines they serve in the restaurant are all natural and biodynamic.\n\nDefinitely can't wait to come back and try something new!\nSee all photos from Johnny N. for Komatsuya",

The second coarse was some slimy wasabi fish pieces. Then came some chewy meat which i shoved in my mouth because at this point i was so hungry that i just needs to get food in my belly. The fourth coarse was a questionable fatty fish bits soup which tasted exactly like everything else, fishy & slimy.\n\nThe only thing that tasted relatively good was the nigiri sushi but then came the $760 bill for 4 people!!\nThis meal was not worth $760 PLUS tip!\nI love japanese food & sushi but this place missed the mark.

The moment you walk into the restaurant, you feel the authenticity through the staff and space design. The manager, Nori, was wonderful and very easy to make conversation with. She described all the courses thoroughly and taught us about the history of the many restaurants they have in Osaka, as well as their winery in France! The food was exceptional! The omakase menu we tasted took our palette on a journey from light, delicate flavors to bold and savory. They change their menu twice a month so I am excited to see what the near future brings!

The experience was outstanding, with each course a unique and thoughtful presentation of quality ingredients. Each course featured meticulous presentation and an impressive combination of flavors and textures. Each dish was unique and delicious.\n\nA really fun aspect of the Komatsuya dining experience is the fixed course menu, which changes twice a month. It's relaxing not having to make menu  decisions, and to be surprised as each course is presented. The wait staff described each course as they were brought out. Many of the courses were comprised of three unique mini platings, and within each small plate were thoughtful combinations of flavors and textures that played nicely together. What a fun experience!\n\nI highly recommend Komatsuya. Take your date here for a fun and unique experience, especially if they are a foodie who can appreciate unique and flavorful cuisine.\n\nWe will definitely be going back!!!!",

I ordered a basic turkey sandwich and was able to make it a combo for a $1 more you get a small bag of chips and a 12 oz soda. The woman at the deli counter was polite and the sandwich was good. Good value for what you pay. The man at the front counter was kinda grumpy. Would it kill your to smile dude? I ate in my car and went to discard my trash. There is no trash can in front of the business, but there was a small box containing trash at the curb, so I left my trash there. May I suggest you place a trash can out front?",

And the owners are incredibly kind. They would give me all kinds of special treatment as a little girl when I would go in. Highly recommend! The rest of the market is filled with traditional liquor store items and it's great having a small local place to pick up things.",

They have lots of items that you'd need in a pinch, but since they're not real well stocked produce-wise, I wouldn't consider them a full grocery store.  \n\nThey do have a nice deli - the roast chicken is my favorite though it's smaller and a bit pricier than the major grocery chains.  Still, it's so flavorful that it's well worth it.  The deli has lots of Middle Eastern items, but they also turn out a good sandwich.  My usual is the Ibis Special with turkey, avo, bacon, cheese.  I've never been disappointed by anything I purchased here.\n\nThis is a family run operation and they're very friendly and helpful.  Every neighborhood should have a market like this.",

AND a LOT of square footage.  You could almost drive a bus through the ailes.  That is kinda nice.  Especially if you are only allowed out of your house in a bus.",

Rotisserie pork, tabbouleh, hummus, bean salad, pita bread and lebni cheese.\nThe kids loved it, my pregnant wife thought I was a hero and most importantly it was jaw dropping delicious.  Sigh....totally not hungry, but I still want more....\nbest of all - NO DISHES!\nUseful 2\nFunny\nCool 1\n1/2/2010Previous review\nAs a small corner market, I can imagine it is difficult to compete with the supers, but Ibis does a fair job on pricing for standard day to day fair.  For the market only, I would probably give Ibis three stars.\n\nHowever, there are a number of things they do superlatively - and this is why we keep coming back.  Namely:\n\n1. Great deli.\n2. Nice selections of beers, wines, and specialty sodas\n3. Fabulous butcher and meats (call ahead if you have a special request)\n4.  Mediterranean dishes (hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouleh, dolmas, baklava) that will knock your socks off.\n5.  Good ice cream for hot summer days. :)\n\nIf you are having a party, David, who is usually at the Deli, will go out of his way to get you great vegetables, meats, and breads.  ",

                  "review": "Am staying in the neighborhood for a couple of months, and so was looking for local places to try. Also, I admit, I really hate huge nationwide chain stores.\n\nAt first, I thought this was just your basic small \"convenience\" kind of store - liquor/wine/beer, the basic necessary grocery items and staple, sodas, a few deli foods.\n\nI was wrong. This place is unique, and the deli and food counter at the rear have some of the best Middle Eastern / Greek / other dishes I've ever eaten. The Baba ghanoush is to die for. The falafel is great, and the garlic dip that comes with it phenomenal. And so on - hummus, stuffed grape leaves, various pasta salads, beef and macaroni, not to mention a decent selection of fresh meats and good cheeses, plus pita and other breads.\n\nThe prices are not outrageously high either. In fact, I got some very nice extra virgin olive oil for WAY less than the same amount would have cost me at a nearby grocery store. It was an import with which I was unfamiliar, but turned out to be excellent and more flavorful than most.\n\nYes, some things will cost you more...but then, a surprising number of things seem to cost less. There are things I wouldn't buy there, for sure. But it's absolutely worth dropping by on a regular basis for the many good imported items (including wine and beer) and the wonderful fresh, homemade items.\n\nBut what REALLY endeared them to me is:  they carry Retsina. OK, I realize a lot of people can't stand the stuff, but I'm nuts about it, and it's hard to find stores that have it in stock, or, for that matter, even know what it is.\n\nSome people have complained Ibis is dark or not particularly clean. Nonsense. It's just not the antiseptic, ultra-bright, fluorescent no-personality generically sanitized atmosphere you get at the corporate big-box stores. So what? If that's what you want, go to Vons or Walmart.\n\nSome of us still prefer local, independent, family-run stores - calm, quiet, comfortable like a favorite pair of shoes. Where you can grab a few necessary items without hiking a quarter mile and waiting in line forever. Where they make real food, not barely edible junk so full of processed additives and artificial ingredients it has to contain twice your daily recommended salt amount to have any taste at all.\n\nWonder if it's too early to go get some baba ghanoush for breakfast?",

It's  only available a few times a weeks after 5pm so you may want to call first. They make great sandwiches to go and their hummus and pita I buy weekly. If you are a beer drinker they have a huge variety and if you want something specific ordered Steve can sometimes get it. Overall a great neighborhood local market.",

WOW that was fabulous!  I even called them after trying to research that recipe and it's an original !  So I'll just have to return to have more.  Too bad they don't ship it. That's a keeper!  Also, love the new set up in store and the\nvariety is great.  I'll be back!  Mary Lou.... Boston   8/10/12",

It has that European convenience store's appearance and functions like one.  They also have a decent selection of wines and fairly priced, good sandwiches.",

I went to another local deli today because it was where my daughter was hanging out with her friends...so thought I would get a sandwich.  May I say that the service was nowhere  near as WONDERFUL AS IT IS AT IBIS, the sandwich didnt TASTE AS GREAT AS THOSE AT IBIS...and the selection does not HOLD A CANDLE!  I only wish that it was a little more updated inside...but that is just cosmetic...if you go there for food, staples, or a snack, you will find want and be very pleasantly surprised!!!",

I made my own assumption it was a soft serve based which kinda was but it was more of a sherbert. It did not taste icy nor harden. It had a creamy sorbet consistency.  I got it in a cake cone but I love cake cone. I do admit I dont think it was a good mix choosing the cake cone. This was my own weird decision. I like how they didn't try to jip you and not stuff the base with sorbet.  Some places tey don't fill the base of the cone!  I should have just had it in the little cup though.  Either way I enjoyed it and would not mind coming back to try their other flavors.  Keep in mind this is a street parking only so good luck everybody.",

There were 8 flavors but none of them on this particular day stuck out for my liking except for one.\n\nI got honey vanilla in a cup with a waffle cone on top and he got tangerine sorbet in a cup. The honey vanilla flavor is exactly what it sounds like, it has a hint of sweet honey and aroma taste of vanilla. Whereas the tangerine sorbet sounds sour because sorbets are usually tarty. Well, if you like bitter then this is for you. It has a bitter taste like a tangerine peel!

I was interested in some of the other flavors they had but focused in on the soft serve because that's what I was in the mood for. There was only one person in line and he didn't take too long so I was able to order pretty quickly. The girl at the counter was super friendly and got my ice cream to me pretty quickly. The ice cream itself was pretty good! I can imagine this place gets pretty crowded during the summer because it's the perfect treat for that time of year but since i'm an ice cream all year type person im very glad I gave them a try. I will say that I went like on a Wednesday afternoon so I was able to find parking but I could see how that could be a problem if easy parking is something you're looking for. There are pints that you can order if you want something to take home. Yes as far as comes go it can be pricey but to me it was worth it! To each their own\nchocolate and vanilla swirl soft serve",

I love that it's just a convenient little window on the sidewalk so grab & go is super easy. I've heard their flavors change, but if you can get the lemon pistachio biscotti, get it!!! It was so freaking yummy I had to really stop myself from getting the pint because I would eat the entire thing in one sitting. I also tried the mint chip which was good.

You've got some nerve making me drive all the way to Mission Hills to get ice cream,  Well you do sell pints so I can limit the time I spend out of the house so I appreciate that. But those cones full of ice cream, especially my new favorite chocolate flavor of all time- Malted Chocolate Brownie, are just so hard to resist. Chocolate ice cream is chocolate ice cream, right? Wrong. It's rich and fudgy, but not cloying and the kind of cone I'm thinking \"ugh too much chocolate, where is some fruit' like I usually do with chocolate. I don't know what kind of magic you're adding to that ice cream, but it's magical.\n\nMy other favorite flavor? Lemon Meringue Pie. You've got tasty nuggets of crust, little rivers of meringue, and bright bursts of citrus from the lemon curd...why have pie when you can have pie ice cream? As I walk up to the window I pretend like I'm going to order a different flavor. As if for the sake of science I'm going to walk away double-fisting two different flavors each time, but I know that I'm just lying to myself. I want your pie.\n\nIt's been a minute since I've had soft serve ice cream. Vanilla just doesn't have the same appeal to me as the more uniquely flavored ice creams usually. But as you're is busting out two flavors of soft serve- Malted Milk and Captain Crunch, I decided to go soft. I opted for the two flavors swirled together so it's a cereal milk situation. You might be wondering if I got this flavor just for nostalgia but I'm here to report that no, I've been eating a box of Captain Crunch for the whole week prior because I enjoy the texture of sugary fiberglass. Your soft serve is topped with a scoop of the captain so everybody knows that I'm nothing but a ballsy basic b eating cereal flavors out in the open in broad daylight instead of hunched over my laptop in pjs watching Matty Matheson scream and cook on Youtube.\n\nWhat I'm saying here is that one can't go wrong with any of the flavors. I enjoy the walk up window situation and the staff is great. Even when I ask something like \"does the cone detract from the flavor or add to it?\" they don't give me a look like DUH. The answer is it always adds. This summer, and the rest of the year because what are CA seasons anyway, I'm telling everyone to head to Mr. Trustee to get a cone or two, before they walk around, sit on the curbside bench right in front of the shop, or head back to their car to eat a delicious treat. Pandemics suck but when one can safely scarf down such tasty ice cream it's made a little easier. Thanks Mr. Trustee!\nSee all photos from Kourtney B. for Mr. Trustee",

It's a walk-up service window currently featuring seven flavors of house-made ice cream, Captain Crunch soft serve, and a berry sorbet. You can purchase by the cup, waffle cone (+$1), or pint. The soft serve is available in a swirl when there is more than flavor.\n\nSigns were placed on the sidewalk to mark off appropriate social distancing. A few customers were ahead of me in line which took about 15 minutes before I was at the front. My choice was a half and half of the Honey Vanilla and Strawberry Cheesecake in a cup. The combination was quite sweet, but refreshing in this heatwave we are experiencing right now.\n\nI give kudos to any business that is making its debut under these trying circumstances which is why I'm a fan of what the owners did here.",

Serves nice and creamy homemade ice cream. Cup is $5, cone is $6,and I think pint is $10.  Flavors Are a bit hard to read and posted near the ordering window. Today's flavors included honey vanilla, malt chocolate brownie, cookies and cream, strawberry cheesecake, mint n Chip, berry sorbet,  butterscotch, captain crunch, and swirl Cap'n Crunch and malt.  My daughter selected cookies and cream and she really enjoyed it. Rich, smooth, creamy.\n\nAs we went around 7:45pm on thursday, About a dozen people were ahead of us in line. Two people were working.\n\nOnly credit cards accepted.\n\nNice addition to neighborhood.\nSee all photos from Sandra C. for Mr. Trustee",

The only reason for 4 stars is for the steep cost, when other ice cream parlors in the area are closer to $8.\n\nThe $10 price tag aside, I was actually impressed with the mint chip flavor because it tasted like actual mint leaves rather than artificial flavoring. There were so many dark chocolate pieces as well. The ice cream was super light, so the pint only lasted 1.5 days between my fianc\u00e9 and myself.\n\nThere was a line around the block when I got there.. and an even a longer line when I left. They adhere to social distancing which is nice. With about 6 people in front of me, my wait was about 15 minutes to get up to the ordering window. I believe they are still offering samples which is nice as well.\nMay 2020",

I have already become a fan of some other places that offer ice cream or gelato like Stella Jean, Mutual Friend, Pappalecco, Moosie's, the list goes on.  So, it is inevitable that I have many points of reference when trying a new place even if it's not exactly fair to group ice cream and gelato under the same category.\n\nPer their namesake, they are part of the ownership of the restaurant Trust.  I honestly had little to no interest in the hype, but my girlfriend insisted on giving it a try.  Of course I wouldn't know about a place until I tried it.\n\nI will say that their ice cream seems to stand more on the lighter texture side.  We are basing this off of the quarts we took home rather than the cones/cups, which we have not tried yet.  I will also mention that you will want to make sure your freezer isn't on the warmest setting.\n\nParking:  Not bad.  Street parking nearby with metered spots free after 6pm.\n\nFYI:\n\n- They tend to run out of certain flavors towards the end of the day, so you will definitely need some back-up choices.",

I tried lemon pistachio biscotti, rocky road, strawberry shortcake, and malted whopper. All the flavors were so good! I wanted to try the other flavors but felt bad for sampling too much. My favorite was the lemon pistachio biscotti but we got pints of that and the rocky road and the rocky road seems to be the favorite among our friends... It had a hint of coffee and also had yummy marshmallows. I also loved the strawberry shortcake flavor, especially with the white chocolate pieces in it, but it did get a little too sweet for me after a while. The ice cream is a bit on the pricy side but is on par with other gourmet ice cream places in San Diego.",

It reminds me of Mr Frosties in PB where I grew up. It doesn't have the surfer vibe of Mr Frosties, but it has the window and soft serve and very well made ice cream. They were out of the swirl machine ice cream but they had scoops of ice cream and we ate right outside on a bench. It was delicious.\n\nThe mint ice cream was a very nice flavor, not a fake flavor but also not like raw mint. The strawberry cheese cake was perfection,",

Cookies and cream is a hard flavor to mess up, but after each bite we were left feeling discouraged by how \"icy\" the ice cream was. Part of what makes ice cream great is a smooth texture...definitely not a hard, icy one. We tried to enjoy it but the flavor was mediocre-to-good and the texture was mediocre-to-bad. Maybe it was a bad day for them? We're willing to try them again to possibly change our minds but as for now... we'll stick with Dixie Pops. The scoop was about the size of a tennis ball and came out to $6 before tip.",

This is an ice cream pick up window adjacent to the yet to open new Trust group restaurant named Cardellino.\nI had to try the soft serve and it was really good. I had the swirl for $5 It was very tiny but satisfying on such a hot day. I also picked up a couple scoops of their regular ice cream to go.\n\nI just tasted the strawberry cheesecake and the malted chocolate brownie from my togo scoops which were $5 each. I really liked the strawberry cheesecake the best. The brownie one was a bit salty for me but I hate salt in desserts.\n\nI look forward to trying out more flavors!\nSee all photos from Adria D. for Mr. Trustee",

Stopped on a warm late afternoon recently and they were out of 3 of their 6 or 7 flavors.  Ok I' certainly understand and asked if more were coming today as it was around 5 ish? ( I thought I arrived to get a good selection) no they were out for the day.  Ok well it must be amazing....no...not quite.  The peanut butter chocolate I had well I could understand why they still had it in stock....the flavor profile had little of that premium butterfat feel that coats your tongue or much flavor of chocolate or peanut butter.? I also had a dark chocolate flavor that also lacked that butterfat feel and had an underwhelming chocolate intensity....if either of the ice creams were decent I could have been ok with the premium price but that was not happening here...\n\nTo add insult to injury after tipping the person 15% for grabbing two pints for me....in my bill I find a 4% cost of living addition on the bill? Don't get me wrong that could be fine if they posted somewhere that this is included in your bill...I did not find it if it's posted ? I could be wrong?  However the ice cream experience here is average at best.  Many better choices in the area including grocery stores...\n\nIt's one of those places you want to like but in this case they make it difficult....super premium pricing, lack of selection, poor execution on flavor and mouth feel....and undisclosed fees which add up.",

If you have eaten at Trust, you have seen the presentation, creativity and tasted the amazing bites. Trust is easily in the top 3 restaurants in San Diego for foodies. This is why Mr Trustee barely gets a 4 star rating. I expected creativity and taste. The ice cream is good but does not live up to what Trust represents in my opinion. If you have never eaten at Trust then you might think its the greatest. I feel Stellas and Salt and Straw are much better with creative unique flavors.",

The waffle cones were great as well.\nThe cashier/attendant seemed a bit overwhelmed. It was busy on a Monday for one person to handle taking payment and scooping.\nMaybe I was there during the only busy hour and sales do not justify having another person there during the shift. Who knows outside of their management... thats for them to decide. All I know is the lady seemed overwhelmed and a bit snappy. To her credit, its Covid-19 season and I am used to seeing stressed out hospitality people right now. A lot of guests are up tight, stressed and rude now more than ever, so I tend to give hospitality people the benefit of the doubt. They are putting themselves at risk so I can have an ice cream. She still got an 18% tip for her work. Its not easy and I appreciate her.\n\nMy only real complaint is their menu board is hard to read. The handwriting is legible, but the marker used is a glossy white. On an opaque menu board, I had to squint and continuously shift my position to make up for the glare. Pretty annoying.\n\nOverall, ill be back. Its chill... literally.",

I decided to try a scoop of cookies and cream. Cookies and cream is a hard flavor to mess up, but after each bite I was left feeling a little discouraged by how icy the ice cream was. The scoop is about the size of a baseball and came out to $6. Would I come back here? No. The flavor was tasty, I just wish the consistency was different and maybe a dollar less? Or a bigger portion for the price? You decide.",

We have also visited and love Trust's growing portfolio of amazing outposts. So, not surprisingly, Mr. Trustee has proven to be another A+. What is crystal clear each and every time I visit a Trust Group eatery (or visit for take out these days) is that they are pre-dedicated to consistent excellence. They clearly determine and endeavor to make the absolute best product possible and thus deliver. In line with that ethos, Mr. Trustee delivers literally the best absolute ice cream experience one could hope to have. It's cute corner location on Goldfinch St. In the charming little downtown of Mission Hills give Mr. Trustee some old fashioned Norman Rockwell vibe. Ice Cream on a warm day at Mr. Trustee is a special treat. The world is a little better because of it!",

For food, we ordered the MEAT LOVER'S MAC and EGGPLANT PARMESAN... both were so deeeelicious!  \n\nChef, taking the time to do his routine 'Meet & Greet', also added a nice familiar feel to the new covid setup.  Seating is separated by plastic curtains and proper social distancing, with hand sanitizer easily accessible.  And the entire team was sporting their stylish Red Door face masks, which added a nice clean touch of uniformity.\n\nFinally, it was so great to see the staff, because as much as we love the food, we've grown to adore the RD team, especially the dynamic duo of Jocie and Ali...and it's one of the major reasons we continue to go back.\n\nbarbyreddoorsd.com",

The owner/head chef and the staff are incredibly welcoming and on point.  The food is delicious, some of the best I've had in San Diego.  Homemade pasta and hand tossed burrata and just the entire selection of food and wine was really impressive.  I'll attach some food photos but they are not worthy of how spectacular they tasted and looked. Will be going back.  Great for a date, adult family hang out, or a dinner with you best friend.",

For HH, we enjoyed the cashew nut crusted chicken wings, but we thought the veal meatballs were too dense (needed some bread crumbs) and the vegetables with pesto should have been a bit more crisp.\n\nI really enjoyed the scallops--this time they came on a round plate instead of a rectangular plate--with parsnip and bacon, vegetables, side of fried kale. The portion size was very respectable too.\n\nChef Luciano came out to talk to us -- twice -- during the night.  He is friendly and personable--what a nice touch! He told us we had to try his dessert (and come back for Lasagna and wine for $25 on Mon nites).  \n\nThe female singer who played acoustic guitar was fabulous--she sang soft rock, oldies but goodies.",

This is located in the area of Mission Hills with ample street parking nearby.\n\nThe inside at first I thought was huge and when I used the restroom towards the end of dinner I realized to the left was a large reflective mirror (LOL).. so the space was actually half the size of what I thought. This place is cozy and has cute decor all around.\n\nThe food I had here was appetizing and enjoyable with comfy seating in the corner! The dishes I tried were the Baja Shrimp in Bone Marrow which came with bread, Pork Pastries, and Fries with Veggies. The drink I had was \"Foster the Goldfinch\" which was refreshing and I could tell there was a lot of TLC put into it. ;)\n\nOverall, a great option when in the area for \"fresh from the farm\" food and drinks with sweet service.~\nSee all photos from Meri D. for BAR by Red Door",

It's located right next door to their sister restaurant, The Red Door, replacing The Wellington. There were succulents hanging on the ceiling, so the decor reminded me of an enchanted little garden.\n\nI sampled a couple of their homemade honeys that they had. They both tasted very good and one had hints of buckwheat. Now I can see what all the buzz is about LOL. The cocktails were beautiful and really strong, but took a while to make. I tried the Los Star Fighter, Smudge and Conjure, and the Zombie Bus Stop. My favorite would have to the be Los Star Fighter since Tequila was used and it had a nice kick to it.\n\nThey only have 5 small plates available and each one was delicious! We were able to try the Baja shriimp and bone marrow, catch of the day, opah de gallo, eggs and sope, carrots and pesto. Each dish was great for sharing and I like that they grow nearly half of their produce used at this restaurant. You can really taste how fresh everything is!\nSee all photos from Dung N. for BAR by Red Door",

Bar by Red Door does not have good service.  It is right by my house and I wanted to have a Moms Night Out there on a Thursday night.  A friend called to ask if we can reserve a couple of tables and was told, \"No reservations.\"  That the only way would be to rent out the whole restaurant for $1800.  Now tell me, if you were a brand new business and wanted to develop a following in the community, wouldn't you cater to the moms and say, sure, come on in!  We would LOVE to have you!  Treat us well and we will be back again and again with our friends, our husbands, our moms...but no.  \n\nWe walked in on the same Thursday but only 5 of us to check it out.  EMPTY!  And there was something off about the service.  The bartender wasn't rude exactly but she didn't exude warmth either.  The beers are only in bottles or cans which is fine.  But there are only 5 choices and they are not on the menu.  The wine list is written on a mirror that you have to strain to see.  Two of us ordered dessert.  Dessert was meh.  No one was happy or even pleasant about the fact that we were there.  The contrast to the place we had just left was amazing.  The place we came from knew which side their bread was buttered.",

It's a small - intimate space, but the personable bartender and servers make it feel nice and cozy.  The live music is a great bonus as well.  The last time I was there was on (cough) Valentine's Day because I was forced to go out against my own will, but I'm glad I did (an obvious romantic).  The owner/chef came out to greet tables and we ended up having a nice conversation with him.  Next thing we know, he randomly brought out his delicious risotto, on the house, followed by an amazing chocolate dessert, also on the house.  His exceptional hospitality, along with the staff's, without doubt made that night 100x more special.  I felt like it was our own private little dinner with all the spoils.  It just might have restored going out on a Hallmark holiday, but only to the Bar by Red Door.",

The bar staff are just as knowledgeable and fun as ever, and the drinks are even better then before. We tried a couple cocktails, which had very clever and inventive ingredients, and enjoyed it all. Also tried the roasted carrots- delicious! Although a bit on the spicy side, so for those sensitive to heat, be aware. Really great experience and can't wait to come back to try more.",

Also, they use the same great menu but, the atmosphere is very lively in the Bar. And, while sitting there, Lori had the special Salmon dinner and I was enjoying the Arugula with Pear salad and then their delicious short ribs dinner. Also, we were entertained by the Spanish guitarist, David Maldonado. He plays there one or two nights a week and he created great music with his mastery of the guitar and his lively selection of classic favorites and today's popular songs. Everyone in the Bar by Red Door were having a great meal and a fabulous time. I highly recommend the Bar by Red Door for a night of good food and great entertainment on a Wednesday thru Sunday evening.",

Cocktails are well thought out and very rum, bourbon and gin intensive. My favorites! The bartender, she lacks personality, though, so the experience is a little soulless. Still, it's lovely and worth a visit!",

Came out on a Monday night and it wasn't busy at all- which I really like because it gives you the opportunity to sit at the bar and chat with the bartender.  The place is very brightly lit, which is way different than the place that used to be here.  \nAs for food, we got the bone marrow and fries w/ veggies- and both were very good - no complaints there.  The drinks were all really good, but my favorite was definitely the good will.  We got to chat with Jason, the bartender, and he even made us a few drinks that he was still working on.  You could tell that he really knew his stuff.\nSince this place just opened up, I'm definitely interested in returning to see how their menu changes/expands.  The bar was a little bit small for how much seating was available, so I do wonder how they will do during a packed night.  But for now, I do really enjoy coming here during non-busy hours and just getting some good drinks.\nSee all photos from Gina F. for BAR by Red Door",

The three appetizers we shared were tasty, particularly the stuffed dates.  The service was fine.  But these types of places are a dime a dozen in San Diego.  I was very sad to see The Wellington go. I loved the dark, Gothic ambiance of the old place, and I wish they had kept more of that vibe for the switch to The Bar.  Even if serving beef is not as environmentally friendly, I really miss the old-school feeling of The Wellington--it was something unique and different in San Diego.  The Bar is no different than a dozen other places in San Diego county, so I am overall a little bummed.",

                  "review": "This is a solid little bar that is close enough to Hillcrest to serve as a getaway from the louder and sometimes dirtier bars of Hillcrest. Service, drinks and food were all good! I asked the bartender (who was also the server, as this is a cozy spot) how much he would hate me if I ordered a Brandy Alexander. Some bartenders don't even know what it is, much less how to make one, but he seemed happy for a bit of a challenge. It was even topped with freshly grated nutmeg, and not pre-ground nutmeg, as the classic recipe calls for. The fries were flavorful and topped with a yummy pico de gallo. We will definitely be back!",

I get it, we are all wearing masks (so I dunno if I am not speaking loud enough but it has happened at 2 locations now) .... where my order goes wrong... \"iced coffee with vanilla and cream, no classic\" super simple i would think...but either I get no half/half or no vanilla... and it was the latter today... the color was spot on and I was super excited as I drove off and took the first sip.. no vanilla.

I arrived at 630 am to be greeted to a, \" you'll have to wait.\" No hi, good morning, how's the weather.. ummm? Charmed I'm sure. The African American employee looks like she hates her job, her life and people in general. She literally gave me the silent treatment and handed off my order with not even a, \"have a nice day\". My theory: if you don't like your job find another one. Why should customers have to be subjected to your horrific attitude and miserable vibe. I'll be calling customer service to file an official complaint. Step it up Starbucks.\n\nUpdate: Halloween decide to give this place another chance to see if anything's changed. Clearly my review was seen and not taken well. I got the cold shoulder from Daniel haha the snooty barista. They proceeded to turn their backs to me and chat pretending I wasn't there. It was honestly comical. You work at Starbucks; enough said. Humble yourself. A little snapshot of my view today  Nice view of your backs. Daniel finally helped me with a indifferent, \"what's up?\" Classy!\nBeing ignored by Daniel and the Manager. Typical experience at this location.\nUseful 2\nFunny 3\nCool",

If you value your time and are in a rush like me Mist of the time, do yourself a favor and try the mobile order. You won't regret it.",

That being said, you can usually count on Starbucks to deliver your favorite beverage with a consistency rarely matched. A latte is a latte regardless of location. For the most part, I appreciate the breakfast food options with oatmeal or the spinach, egg white & feta wrap being my usual order. I'm watching my carbs right now so I was intrigued by their newly released sous vide eggs. I've seen their photos but was floored when I saw them in person in their display case. But I'll let you be the judge. Are these the same product as in their photo ads?\nReality vs the \"promise\" in the photos. Their sous vide eggs.",

I asked a manager, and she was nice about it, but didn't seem to happy once my coffee was served to me. There is also a serious lack of plugins here. They need to come up with something so people can plug their laptops in. Right now you have to lucky and get a table in one of 4 corners of the store. In future I will start utilizing Lestat's. Min wage is increasing, and they still cannot get it together with 5-6 employees behind the counter. Please be more observant and keep the house clean.\nUseful\nFunny\nCool\n12/7/2013Previous review\nI frequent this location often. It looks better than previously, but they still need more outlets to plug laptops into. For such a busy location, I am really shocked they didn't think of this sooner. The staff is friendly, very helpful, and the drinks are good. However, each time I come it seems like they support their local bum population. Last time a homeless guy with dreads was screaming and throwing things. This time another bum was just loitering and taking up the tables with all his personal belongings and kept coming in and out and screaming.  I wanted to use the only open table next to him, but I couldn't handle the smell and constant loudness; it was very disruptive. I understand they are people too, but if they don't get this under control, I am going to start hitting another location in the area.  The Vons location has better seating, bigger tables, but the Kiosk locations won't even allow you to redeem your rewards!  If you're looking for a place to study... this isn't a good option. It's advisable to make sure there are ample plug-ins and less bums.",

Boise or Bangkok, you'll get Starbucks. That certainly has always been my experience with brick and mortar, stand alone Starbucks locations and this is the first one fly in the face of that - grocery stores and kiosks excluded.\n\nThe staff seemed out of step, forgetting to accept payment and lacking the pizazz (phony or not) that is sometimes annoying but greatly missed when not present. Everyone is here for business as usual, nothing more, nothing less and that's made clear. Aside from that, you'll find exactly what you get at any other Starbucks when it comes to quality.

Our neighborhood Starbucks is not only the worst Starbucks I've ever visited; it's one of the worst businesses I've ever visited.\n\nI suggested periodic power spraying and a Starbucks employee replied that they couldn't do this because of water shortage.  I can't tell you how many times we have sat on the Starbucks patio and watched the business directly across the street power wash their sidewalks.  \n\nIn short, the Starbucks at Washington and Falcon is a filthy and poorly run store.",

Unlike all of the other Starbucks in the city of San Diego?? She talked down to me and told me that \"we had talked about this before\" along with other rude comments. I was so insulted that I called customer service who apologized to me and gave a $10.00 credit since I was a gold card member.\n\nNonetheless, I'm done with this location until Starbucks gets rid of this rude employee or sends her on her way one way or another. She is not mgr material what so ever!\n\nIt's very sad because it's a 5 star location with great google internet speed and all the rest of employee's are very nice and even do refills for me when she is not there.. go figure!\n\nNow I'm at another Starbucks who charged me 50 cents for the green tea lemonade refill while writing this review! And they apologized for her attitude toward me too.\nUseful 4\nFunny 1\nCool\n11/6/2014Previous review\nThey have the new Google High Speed Internet service which makes using your laptop so much easier!\n\nThe staff is pleasant and always friendly, except for the manger Portia who is really moody about refills and does not like to do them. Outside of that the rest of the staff is very pleasant to deal with and their service is great!\n\nThe only downside is AC, it's not very pleasant on the floor on warm days. It works well for the staff up at the counter but not very well for the general floor. It get's pretty HOT by the windows somedays.",

They talk about smaller coffee places squeezed out but the truth is, this is the closest one to me (although Its a Grind just opened a couple of blocks).  However, I am addicted to the Starbucks Cafe Mocha, at first milk did not agree with me (lactose intolerant) so I never really bought it at all. Then I discovered the soy milk in Cafe Mocha tastes the same as with milk with no stomach ache.  I rarely drink soy milk except to pour in my coffee.  Now I pour coffee in my soy milk (how ironic).  Okay to get back to these particular Starbucks. They know me and I have been a regular for like ages (or at least the last 2 years since we moved to Mission Hills).  However, I always have fun on how they spell my name.  And of course sometimes, there is a newbie, they ask me for my name and they constantly misspell my name.  Its fun, I think the first couple of months, my name was misspelled one way or another.  I just didn't know you can misspell Melanio so many times, Milano, Milanio, Melani, Milan, etc.   However, my routine has become to go get my cafe mocha with soy with whip (tapers the hotness of the coffee) before work and before shopping on Sundays.  I have cut down from 6 days a week to 3 days a week (I buy the Thur Union Trib, Fri NYTimes and Sund NYTmes) , the other weekdays, I live with coffee made at work with my coffeemate.  Again Curse on you OPEC!!\nBut for a Starbucks, this one is pretty friendly and not too big for its britches.  Although sometimes those newbies are slower and makes it really frustrating to wait when you are running late already at work.\nEven falling in line makes for fun people watching.",

I don't know how you acquired that position of being a store manager when you clearly have no management skills and lack the very basic foundation of retaining clientele which is \"Customer Service\".  \nWhen one f@*&$ up an order, logical and appropriate action would be to apologize for messing it up and forgetting to make it and not acknowledge the customer waiting for 15-20 minutes for a drink they ordered for pick up. Typically, when someone places an order for pickup, it is due to its convenient process, cutting wait time as they may b running late for work, gym or for whatever reasons they may have for wanting to utilize the \"grab and go\" process for their own personal preference. So you just made the customer wait 15-20 minutes because you messed up the order and failed to remake it. And had I not asked, I'd still be waiting for my grande latte til you may have noticed I've been standing there for the last hour, on top of that you have the audacity to throw in an attitude because I asked you to remake my order the way I placed it with no whip and extra shot, are you serious?!?!?. Common courtesy, specially in the service industry, that when a paying customer makes a request for their drink, (last I checked, I believe you can still personalize drinks at Starbucks right?) that you at least acknowledge that you heard them and not just ignore them.\nFurthermore, being of a higher position such as a \"store manager\", does not give you the power to belittle other employees below your title, you do not have the right to embarrass other employees in front of customers because they didn't make a drink properly or their skills is a bit off. A great leader would wait til the store is not that busy, you pull the employee in the back or the employee lounge and constructively, speak to her about where she can improve her skills, then again you clearly do not possess any of those skills yourself so you probably wouldn't know how to do that either....again, management skills workshop will definitely do you some good...and you're welcome.\nKudos to you Jessica \"the store manager\" and starbucks of Falcon and Washington for employing a rude and unprofessional individual and most of all for providing the worst Starbucks service and loosing a local customer who now have to drive to little Italy for her latte.",

To a tall, bald, mostly mustache fellow I order, \"A Grande Mocha Frappachino for here. In a glass. And a piece of pound cake.\" He charges my card, gives me the cake, and I go to a table while the drink is made. \"Grande mocha Frappachino for here\" is called.\nI go to the counter and there is a drink with whip cream on top in a coffee cup. I tell the girl I ordered my Frappachino \"for here, in a glass.\" She says, \"The cup is what they gave me with your order.\" Tall Mustache rushes over and says, \"We don't have glasses at this location.\" I say, \"You don't have ANY glasses?\" (The walls and door have pictures of drinks in glasses.) He says that's right, the location has no glasses.\n\"Congratulations,\" I say, \"You have the only Starbucks in San Diego without a glass.\" I shake my head, bewildered. \"Dumb.\"\nI pick up the coffee cup (I'm thirsty) and return to my table, where I'm eating the cake and sipping the drink when Tall Mustache comes over, so excited he's bouncing from foot to foot.\n\"Did you call me dumb?\" he says, eyes popping. I point to an ad for machiattos, in glasses, on the wall, \"If I want a machiatto like that you can't give it to me. There's an ad on the door for ice tea in a glass which you can't sell me. Was it a managerial decision not to have glasses at this location?\"  \"Yes,\" he says. \"It was a dumb managerial decision\" I say. \"You're the manager.\"\nHe bounces and says Starbucks doesn't allow its managers to be disrespected and more that I don't understand because it's too fast. \"You must leave,\" he orders.\nI'm halfway through the cake, have sipped some of the drink, and am a third through the newspaper section I'm reading. I say I'm not leaving. He puts some cash on the table, says it's a refund, and he is calling the police to make me leave. When I finish the cake, drink and newspaper, I leave, passing a girl about 12 years old at a seat with her dog on a leash. If I mentioned it to Tall Mustache he'd say it's a Service Dog.\n\nTall Mustache's conduct was much more antagonistic and childish than it may appear here. Starbucks seems to assign its worst people as \"managers\" here. I've never been in a Starbucks that had no glasses. I'd waited until they were washed in busy times, but this fellow apparently won't be bother washing them.\nUseful\nFunny 2\nCool\n1/11/2017Previous review\n1/8/2017, 4:15 PM. A woman sits at the table next to mine, with a dog on her lap, its paws on the table. I go to the counter and ask for the manager. The barrista says he is the manager. I say there's a dog at a table with its paws on it. He says, \"So?\" I say it's against the Health Code. He says its a service dog. There follows some conversation that shows Starbucks has not trained its people in ADA rules. I finally say even if it is a service dog they are not allowed to have their paws on tables. The \"manager\" shrugs, and walks away. As I leave, I see the woman is trying to conceal the dog with her arms, but its front paws are still on the table. That table will, of course, not be wiped with Lysol or another disinfectant when the dog leaves.\n\nI was going to give the place two stars before the dog incident because the only liquid ever out is half&half, if even that is--you must often ask at the counter for a milk container, and will be given half&half unless you specify what kind of milk you want--they are apparently too lazy to maintain and clean several thermoses of milk. They don't keep even all the three coffee specials made, and I must wait while a \"pour-over\"is made.",

If you're like me and spend more than $10 a day drinking foofy caffeinated beverages from this urban virus, we need to start a 12-step program or demand company stock for keeping them in business.\n\nI hate to love this little Starbucks (one of their smaller joints,) but I do. The line here gets long, especially during the 7-9AM rush. But, like a drug dealer, they know we'll wait it out! These jovial little caffeine pushers happily take cash (or plastic) for my quick fix in any venti form - then try to up sell me one of their impulse items, music, branded shwag or carbs from the muffin case. I stick strictly to the liquid smack...it's Starbucks after all, not 7-Eleven.\n\nAnd you know you're an addict when you're too embarrassed to go to the same location you've been to already twice that day, so you search Yelp for the nearest SBux drive-through, only to find yourself driving like a fiend needing a fix three miles out of your way to PB.\n\nAh, the creamy wonderfulness of an iced venti non-fat 3-pump MochaRas, no whip lite ice.\n\nOr the piping hot smoothness of a venti 170 degree percent 4 pump Tux, no whip with an add-shot.\n\nThen...\n\n15 minutes later, the coffee's gone, you're wired and stuck at your desk hating yourself while looking at your online bank statement in shame after realizing you've just spent a car payment's-worth of card swipes that month at Starbucks and all you have to show for it - besides mid-day ADD - is a ginormous stack of clear plastic cups you can't do anything with.\n\nOh shit, I'm jonesin' again, gotta go get my drink on!",

And please baristas, pay attention to whipped cream requests. There has been about a string of three different vanilla lattes that have almost had final lids shut on them without it. Not pleased with this.\n\nI'm already ready to fall asleep before getting caffeine in my system but these people have no sense of urgency in a workweek pick me up.\n\nThe only reason I keep coming back is because of the card convenience.",

It was a nightmare, and I will not be going back here anytime soon.",

No one was at the counter either ordering or waiting for an order.  I walked up to the order counter and saw three employees behind the counter: one cleaning the coffee filters, one cleaning off the barista counter and one rearranging the muffins in the display counter.  So I waited.  After a bit I looked up to see if perhaps I was standing in the wrong place and they thought I was waiting for my order, but no I was at the order counter.  The barista looked over at me and then back down at the counter he was cleaning.  The gal arranging the muffins looked at me for a second and then continued arranging the muffins.  The guy cleaning the coffee filter never turned around.  I waited some more.  Then the gal arranging the muffins came around to the front of the counter to see the result of her arranging.  Again she looked at me and said nothing.  So I finally said to her, \"does anyone work here?\"  She pointed to the gentleman cleaning the coffee filter and said \"he's on register today but he's cleaning up right now.\"\nSeriously????????  Three people working there only one customer waiting and there isn't even an acknowledgement that I've been there or am waiting.  I have heard complaints about this location before but now I believe it because I experienced it myself.",

A green tea lemonade doesnt get refills you probably got store credit because you lied and said green tea refill you obviously are not a gold member if you were you would know this. And if your drink has too much ice  all you do is ask for easy Ice. There are no such things as iced for here glasses its only advertised as such you are petty because no starbucks in san diego carries those. Its always funny to read yelp reviews on places you often visit. But, anywho the staff here is amazing as many other locations. It is a smaller store so I can never really sit down because tables are often full and being used. Barista was very helpful I normally get the same drinks they made a bomb recommendation.

The person taking the order has been chatting the whole time with a customer ahead of me, a regular.  Then she chats while making the customer's drinks.  Then she makes the drink for the person BEHIND me.  \nWant to know how hard it is to make an iced decaf americano?  A machine is turned on, coffee is dumped in a plastic cup, water and ice are added.  Boom.  So barista hands me a drink finally, after I'm standing there for 5 minutes, and I say, seeing the cup, \"Is that decaf?\"  \"Oh, no, I didn't hear you say decaf.\"  No doubt:  you were too busy chatting up a regular!  So then barista whisks out my drink, after I've been there 10 minutes with few people,  it has maybe 3 cubes of ice which melt by the time I get to the creamer station.  AND it's weak.  Just terrible.  I'll never go to this one again.  Save your money and go to nearby Meshuggah Shack or Coffee Bean.",

There is a guy, short, heavy set possibly Hispanic who has tarnished this franchisee's reputation.  He treats men with such contempt. NO eye contact, No please or thank you.  He ignores me so much that half the time he forgets to charge me for other items I have ordered. However, if a woman is in front of him, he's more friendly Duh.  There is also an African American woman who never makes eye contact.  I swear she wanted to stab me when I politely asked her to please warm up my scone. She practically threw it at me after she bagged it!  I don't need to be treated this poorly too many times to take my business else where. I wrote the corporate offices and got a form letter apology and a free drink coupon.  Thanks Starbucks but I'm not spending a dime at this location again.  I'm glad I'm not the only person who feels the baristas here are horrible. So sad there are so many service oriented people with out jobs right now and this location obviously hasn't hired them.",
